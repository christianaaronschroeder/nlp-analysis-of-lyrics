    "For this project I decided to analyze the lyrical styles and semantics of the most lyrical rappers. To define the 'most lyrical' rappers, I used the output data of a well known project by Matt Daniels from 2019, \"The Largest Vocabulary In Hip Hop,\" https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/index.html. In his work, Daniels compiled a list 160 rappers with the most diverse vocabularies throughout their discography. I used this list and lyrical rankings, along with data on Grammy and Billboard awards and nominations, to explore how diversification of lyrics, styles, and semantics could impact the success of a rapper."

    "Using the Genius API I can access and download the lyrics for any song by an artist within the genius.com database. Through this I can request the top K most popular songs by each artist in my list, where popularity is determined by the frequency of visits to that song's lyrics page on the Genius website. As Genius is the leading website for song lyrics, I felt confident that their popularity rankings for each artist would roughly match those that may be found from streaming services. I had to make sure I was pulling enough songs per artist to get a corpus that strongly defined each rapper's style and popular themes. I wanted as much data as possible, but did not want to introduce possible bias by including songs from artists that were not popular. I believed it reasonable to assume the common listener would not be able to name 25 songs by a single artist off the top of their head. So, I decided to pull the top 25 most popular songs per artist. This gave me substantial amount of songs to work with, while hopefully not minimizing possible bias from unpopular songs."
