That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby

Let me get back on my hustle, fuck a friend, it's off the muscle (Ha)
You smoking dick, you think I trust you? (Mhm)
Burn a nigga like I'm Usher (Boom)
I don't go back and forth all on the internet, have no interest for discussion (No)
Pull her hair and choke her while we fucking, I probably give her a concussion
I need a plate and I ain't tryna wait, I'm so fucking hungry I could starve
My nigga snuck in with the rod, I'm 'bout whatever, that's on God
I go to jail, I pay the bond, please don't waste my fucking time
Hate on me, I hit your ho (Ho), play with me, I get that iron
Can we fucking keep a secret? That's a .40, bitch, I keep it (Boom)
My bitch a fucking Puerto Rican, I fuck her every other weekend
They swagger jacking, I can peep it, these nigga jacking my steelo
Bitch, it's a brick, it's a kilo (Brick), I beat a nigga up like Deebo
His bitch got at me on the d-low (Shh), I'm wit' my niggas shooting CeeLo
Wouldn't run up on me, that's a no-go (Brr), I keep it on me like it's legal, bitch
DaBaby, DaBaby, DaBaby, DaBaby
Ha


That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby
Firzt on the track
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, yeah

They should've told you I'm coming, nigga play with me, I mop it (It's up)
Pull up on me, think I'm bluffing? Bust it on you, have you running (Brr)
Your bitch can get it if she want it (Oh yeah)
I'm killing your bitch from the back, I smack her ass and keep her coming (hey)
All my nigga, they a hundred, police behind me, I'm running (I'm gone)
My ho make your ho look ugly, I don't do dimes, I do twenties (For real)
Twenty thousand on a Monday (Twenty), thirty thousand on a Tuesday
Caught your bitch out on a Wednesday, she like my style, I had her choosing (Uh)
Sleep on me and then you losing, got a beam on the chopper (Boom)
Make you lean when I pop it, got some lean from the doctor
Wherever you see me, I'm ready, my name hold weight, this shit heavy
Got your bitch face in my lap, parked at the 7-Eleven
Yeah, we at pump number nine, this ain't no pump, this a iron
They ain't let me in with the .40, snuck in the back with the .9
These nigga be acting and lying, posting up statuses, crying
There really, really ain't no real niggas
And I'm 'bout to light the bih line, ayy
DaBaby
