Nigga I can't lie, shit changed
When I start countin' the faces
Soon as I bust my face down
All these niggas wanna hate me now
Got bleu cheese in the safe now
Diamonds outline my name now
I done seen the worst outcomes
Why a nigga ride around with my drum (Yeah, yeah)

Why these niggas gotta envy me? (Tell me, why, though?)
Is it cause I got them racks on me?
Chanel's on the drip, double C
Jewelry cold as the ice in my lean (Yeah, yeah)
I was in the field, like Madden (Madden)
Hopped off the porch, and I ain't know what happened (What happened)
I can feel this codeine in my abdomen
Now I got more money than I was fathomin'
I was rich, went broke, and got a bag again
I just wanna make sure I got enough saved for the kids
I just wanna make sure my habits ain't affectin' the way I live
I came up out the streets, nigga I can't lie that's how I live

Nigga I can't lie, shit changed
When I start countin' the faces
Soon as I bust my face down
All these niggas wanna hate me now
Got bleu cheese in the safe now
Diamonds outline my name now
I done seen the worst outcomes
Why a nigga ride around with my drum (Yeah, yeah)
