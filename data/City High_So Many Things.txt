Hmm
(listen)
I don't understand
Why you had to go
I guess I'll never know
Why life seems so hard
Since you went away
There's still some things I got to say
Even though I'm all alone
I know u want me to be strong
And standin tall admist the rain
Without you life just ain't the same
(Chorus)
And there are so many things
I'd like to ask you
And there are so many things
I still don't know
And there are so many things
I'd like to ask you
Still yet so many things
That I will never know
(ohhh ohhh)
If there was any way
I could see your face again
I'd give my own life
Only you can ease my pain
And if I could turn back the hands of time
It would take me just a moment
To tell you what's on my mind
Even though I'm all alone
I know you want me to be strong
And standin tall, amidst the rain
With out you life just ain't the same
Chorus
(listen)
Sometimes I sit and wonder
Will we ever meet again (will we meet, aggaaain)
Wohhohh
But where ever life may lead you (eva, eva)
You'll always have (always have)
A friend in me (in me)
