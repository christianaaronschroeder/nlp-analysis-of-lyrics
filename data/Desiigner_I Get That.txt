Woah, you dig
(Ayo Razy, this shit crazy)

I get that, get that loaf (Loaf)
I get that, you want smoke (Smoke)
I get your, I'm a ho
She want a nigga from New York
Hold it, huh
I'm ridin' through the block in a Phantom, hold (Oh)
She diggin' on me 'cause I'm handsome
I get that, get that loaf (Loaf)
I get that, you want smoke (Smoke)
I get your, I'm a ho
She want a nigga from New York
Hold it, huh
I'm ridin' through the block in a Phantom, hold
She diggin' on me 'cause I'm handsome, ayy

Nigga, I'm lit
I come from the bottom, I come with the shit
Remember the days when I had to go whip
Now I got bitches, they come on the ship, hey, ayy
Paid four five for the Phantom, woah, huh
Holdin' up a lick for the ransom
I get that for the low (Low)
I get that, you want smoke (Smoke)
I get your, she a ho
She want a nigga who gon' tote
She want a, who get money
I wanna, in her tummy
I'ma just, keep one hundred
I let her when she want it

Shooters they in the V
Put 'em all on a tee
May the dead rest in peace
Make the opps go to sleep
Let you know I'm a G
Pay the field with the heat
Louis kicks, Louis V
Make it bounce just for me

I get that, get that loaf (Loaf)
I get that, you want smoke (Smoke)
I get your, I'm a ho
She want a nigga from New York
Hold it, huh
I'm ridin' through the block in a Phantom, hold (Oh)
She diggin' on me 'cause I'm handsome
I get that, get that loaf (Loaf)
I get that, you want smoke (Smoke)
I get your, I'm a ho
She want a nigga from New York
Hold it, huh
I'm ridin' through the block in a Phantom, hold (Oh)
She diggin' on me 'cause I'm handsome, hey
