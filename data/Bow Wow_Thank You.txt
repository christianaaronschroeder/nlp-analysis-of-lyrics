Uh, uh
Yeah, uh-huh (So So Def), uh
If you ever bought a tape (Yeah)
Purchased a CD (Uh-huh)
Or a piece of vinyl (C'mon)
DJed my record (Rock, rock on)
Promoted my record (Tell 'em)
I wanna thank y'all, man, from the bottom of my heart (That's right)
Secondly, I wanna dedicate this song to y'all, man
'Cause without y'all, there is no me (C'mon)

I could never turn my back on y'all, 'cause y'all put me where I'm at
So when you call, I'll be there, just like that
Signin' autographs, givin' daps to all my folks
Tellin' little kids, don't follow these dopes
See, I'ma keep barkin' long as y'all bark with me (Woof)
You know the website, all y'all gotta do is hit me
And as much as the girls like me, you would think it make the fellas sick
But they be right with 'em singin', not missin' a lick
Hair braided, rockin' somebody's jersey
From up top to out west and down in the dirty
Can't forget about the midwest, that's where I was found
That's where I live and Columbus is the town
I got the pen, you got the paper, a CD, a tape, I
Sign it then leave it to get a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without y'all, I couldn't kick it like this
I wanna thank you
For makin' me who I am and puttin' me where I need to be
I wanna thank you
For the opportunity to do my thing in this industry
I wanna thank you
For callin' to your local stations day after day to play my song
If it wasn't for you, there wouldn't be no me
And that's why I'm gonna ride for you forevermore (For more)
Forevermore, forever more
I just wanna thank you

I wanna thank you for the groups that came before me
All of y'all in the office that promote me on the streets
All the mom and pop stores that don't get a lot of credit
The spots in the hood, the first ones that set it
All the mix show DJs, please keep it pumpin'
Thank you for your support, and yes, I'm gonna keep it comin'
I love how you love that, so I'm givin' back
'Cause y'all the ones that kept this playa on track
The reason I'm seen is because of you
The reason I'm heard and my dreams came true
Now, if you ever made a poster, or wrote a fan letter
All I'm tryin' do is show you is some L-O-V-E
And let you know without y'all, there is no me
J.D., J.E., the whole S.S.D.Â 
Now if you ride for we, then I'ma ride for you
From the bottom of my heart, baby, tell 'em what I wanna do
I wanna thank you
For makin' me who I am and puttin' me where I need to be
I wanna thank you
For the opportunity to do my thing in this industry
I wanna thank you
For callin' in to your local stations day after day to play my song
If it wasn't for you, there wouldn't be no me
And that's why I'm gonna ride for you forevermore (More)
Thank you, thank you, thank you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thank you, thank you, thank you (I just wanna say thank you)
I wanna thank you

Thank you
To all of y'all that's been down with So So Def for so long, man
You keep showin' us love, so we gon' keep showin' y'all love, you know what I'm sayin'?
We just want y'all to know that
And uh, to the man upstairs, we gotta thank you the most, you know what I'm sayin'?
If it wasn't for you, there wouldn't be no me
For real man, thank you
Columbus, rock, rock-rock-rock on
ATL, rock-rock-rock on
St. Louis, rock-rock-rock on
New York, rock-rock-rock on
Cali, rock-rock-rock on
