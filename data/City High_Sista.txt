Now you's my boy and all
But we need to talk
Stop by the store bring ya ball
Let's hit the park
I'm gonna rap for a minute
But don't take it hard
Cause I'm hoping afterwards
You'll still be my partner
It's hard for me to express
How I'm feelin and
When you hear
This news you might
Fly through the ceiling
But I'm willing to
Let you know the truth and
In fact it's better that I told you
For you hear the story back
It's bout this new girl
I'm creeping
Its my little secret and
I can hardly keep it
Yo peep it
It's yo sista
Yea homie i been wit her
I been wit her for a while now
There's nothin you can do about it
(this is stressin me out)
It's yo sista
Yea homie I been wit her
I been wit her for a while now
There's nothin you can do about it
The first time i ever seen her
Ya'll moved around my way
I was diein to met her
But i met you first and we became real cool
Started hangin out at school
Now why you reachin for your tool
Ain't no need for no beef so stop actin the irrational
Still that same brother who always had your back for you
You know i would never hurt you or try to be foul
Besides you don't want your niece growin up with out her daddy around
That's right your babby sisters quite pregnant
And we've already checked into meetin with da reverand
It's yo sista
Yea homie i been wit her
I been wit her for a while now
Theres nothin you can do about it
It's yo sista
Yea homie i been with her
I been with her for awhile now (cause i luv her)
Theres nothin you can do about it
It's yo sista
Yea homie i been wit her
I been with her for awhile now
There's nothin you can do about it
It's yo sista
Yea homis i ben wit her
I been wit her for awhile now
There's nuthin you can do about it
(your my best friend,please try to understand)
It's yo sista
You know i love her
I'd never hurt her
Won't never leave her
It's yo sista
You know i love her
I'd never hurt her
Won't never leave her
It's yo sista
Yoou know i love her
I'd nenver hurt her
Won't never leave her
It's yo sista
You know i love her
I'd never hurt her
Won't never leave her
Remember the day i never made it to hoop practice?
I wasn't really sick and layed up
I made up that whole story just so i could be with the girl
She makes my heart skip a beat
Lolli pops call her sweet
The twinkle in her eye and the dimples in her cheek
Everytime i see her smile i swear my knees get weak
I swear my knees get weak...
