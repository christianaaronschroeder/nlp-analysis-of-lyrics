Tripolar, they gon' say money make me wild
High roller, throw a million dollars in the crowd
G'up flying through the clouds
Only God get higher than I and the pilot, couldn't get flyer than I
Desire got fire in his eyes and his stomach
Just wait 'til you get what you got coming
With the greedy thing, I turn Citibank to Diddy bank
And I don't care about your piggy bank
You a silly boy, I'm a billy boy
I ain't got to touch it, get one at my young Philly boys
Harlem renaissance, upper echelon
Check writer, the nigga they come and check upon
Nigga please, used to spend G's in a restaurant
7 on the entr√©e, 3 on the dessert
Ask for the job cause you know you need to wizzerk, jizzerk

You know me you know we don't sleep
Like I was there at the Carter for the Nino speech
Rothstein in Casino reach with no Ginger
Everybody copy my style is infringement
You know me you know we don't sleep
Like I was there at the Carter for the Nino speech
Rothstein in Casino reach with no Ginger

Yeah, kill shit and get the same time Max B got
This dude with his colorful chains, rap peacocks
As far as the game, I was in it I represent it
Way back when heroin became a epidemic
And the Feds are dead, at least a certain percentage
Only hurting your image, your whole life's a gimmick
And we can't click 'cause you all petty
I done told you I'm heavy, like New York Freddy
It's a honor to meet him, a pleasure to speak with him
Trunk full of champagne bottles with leak in 'em
Street value say it's a million in each of 'em
Contracts in the hood ain't no breaching 'em
Yeah, the profit is tremendous (yup)
But the gossip is still endless, no way you can offend us
Peter Shue parties with Madonna in attendance, wow!

Old wild man, can I ask you nice?
Swimming in the dark 'cause the pool got lights
Money in the bank yeah who got dice?
Harlem World, Double Up and I can pull that twice, yeah
You got ice and you got ice
Then I must got glaciers, fuck it I got paper
Looking at my house and fuck it I got acres
Drinking the liquor but not using the chaser
If rap's the desert then I'm the oasis
I guess I'm demanding a standing ovation
Look at the map I can land in locations
That's slick talk, two fifth talk
In Cali it's kush but in New York it's piff talk
Why don't you come listen to Mitch talk
Pulling the 6 off
Rich nigga that tricks off
In the telly knocking your bitch off.. Mitch
You must want me to blow your brains out
Gift when you present with niggas that move the 'caine out
Did you really know what the pain 'bout?
When you start eating and niggas come with their fangs out
You like fuck it I got my chain out
Got a couple goons but they don't know what the game 'bout
Are they really ready to bang out?
Call my guns nuts so fuck it I let 'em hang out
She rock Vera, me I'm Alexander Wang'd-out
Not that clear if I'm insane or sane now
'Cause I see the sunshine in the rain now (I see)
I could feel the loss in the game now
Since hey now, had a baby on the way now
I be strapped up like get down and lay down
No school zone, no shell in the playground
I don't fuck around, I don't sniff what I weigh, clown
Wow! Yeah

You know me you know we don't sleep
Like I was there at the Carter for the Nino speech
Rothstein in Casino reach with no Ginger
Everybody copy my style is infringement
