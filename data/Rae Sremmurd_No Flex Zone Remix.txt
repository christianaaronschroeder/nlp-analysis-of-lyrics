Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!
When I slide down the ave I'm fuckin' trippin' (damn)
Maserati bat black, all I wanna know is where the cash at?
TNT tucked in my 'rillo, hundred racks under my pillow
Different styles, I'm so versatile, nigga you know like I know
Jimmy, Lil Swae, hoes on the chase
Cash in the air make her forget her date
Heard of my plan, she fuckin' with me anyway
If she thicky like Nicki I put that pussy on my plate
How you not notice the flyest niggas in the place?
I hit the liquid and started drippin' into space
Hublot tickin', blowin' kisses at your baby
Have fun, shotkilla like Mike reincarnated
Throwin' out a fuckin' end
I'm blowin' money in the wind
I'm sick of wearin' skinny jeans
I'm more into wearin' Louis V's
These hoes don't fuckin' listen
These niggas don't pay attention
These bitches are not yours
We keep them on all fours
Breakin' down', rollin' up potent
Sippin' champagne like soda, poppin' red bitches like cola
Trunk beat like Eardrummers
Sremm killed the haters, God bless 'em
Mothafuckas still all in my bone marrow
Flyin' through the air like a fuckin' air devil
All these broke niggas just fish in a barrel
Run back up and I turn into a bezel
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!
Hell no, you can't use my lip gloss
Pop a Perc', now I'm on lift off
Ass still fat, it's on Rick Ross
You bitches make a nigga dick soft
Bitch, ball like I'm at tip off
Get it, get it wet, then I rub the tip on
Rag and Bone jeans, I can slip off
Bitch, I've been hot since flip phones
Running this game for five years
Guess that's why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me, do these bitches' teeth hurt?
Yes, I am an icon, that's me on your T-shirt
Thought you knew better, do your fucking research
You ain’t know, this the no rip zone
This the You Can't Beat Nic zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home
I live next door to Brad Pitt’s home
I like bad bitches, cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick' magnitude
Even if they had a longitude, latitude
Listen up, ho, this is my territory
You are my son, like an episode of Maury
Like an episode of ER, bitch, I’m hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skills, nobody wanna see her
Muhfuckas flexin', muhfuckas actin'
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions
Ain’t pushing out, I'ma give them to the clinic
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick
Wack sauce, I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you’re ugly, it’s a no text zone
It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone
Wack sauce, I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you’re ugly, it’s a no text zone
It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!
Who ain't waiting on King Push?
Got niggas checking for them new flows
Sold more dope than the old Jigga
Now niggas calling me the new Hov
Let the coupe go, planetarium
Let the roof go like Cesarean
Clear my section nigga, no flexing nigga
Just a hunnid bottles they carrying
Cross the border like I lost a daughter
This foreign nigga, he ain't know better
Him pick and choose where them bullets fly
I lose the plane on this fool nigga
Bought dope with my album budget
Play Cloths was the blueprint
Four million in four seasons
Fuck who care for my fashion sense
Tell a ho come and swim in the money (splash)
Broke niggas just stop at the heel
I could body paint you in them name brands
And put a red bow on the wheels
See I'm just in and out, I call a rent a mouth
Suck the ice out of a bezel
Use my rap persona, fuck baby mommas
Still killin' haters, God bless em'
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!
