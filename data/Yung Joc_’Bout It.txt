(Shh, Kwamé did it)
Yuh (Yeah)
Y'all know what it is (Mmm)
It's homey Yung Joc, man
Block Entertainment (Uh-huh)
Bad Boy South (Let's go)
Aye, Kwamé (What up)
You hear 'em fizzle, boy
Let's go, step up

You think you know me
But you have no idea
Act like you 'bout it
Well let me put this in your ear
If you really 'bout it
Do it like a boss like you don't care
If you 'bout it, I don't doubt it
Show me that you sho'nuff 'bout it, 'bout it

I get mine off top cause the hustle don't stop
If your girl don't chew, then my name ain't Joc
The money don't flip, then the block ain't hot
If she don't scream your name, then your game just shot
I gotta couple reasons you can call me the boss
I'll drop a couple stacks and watch your ass get lost
Now, Joc a real bet, shorty best believe that
If you ain't ride or die, bring them car keys back
Take your foot off the brake, baby, gon' ride out
If them suckers wanna hate, put 'em in time out
I get that cake and you'll soon find out
If you ever cross me, you'll get crossed out
I've seen it before in a rhyme and roll
Come and catch up with me, baby, don't stop (Don't stop)
Get to the floor, whatchu waitin' for
Cause we can ride the beat straight to the top
You waitin' too long and now it's my time
To show 'em all that it's not a game
Cause I don't care what I'm lookin' like, I just gotta show you that
I'm not goin' nowhere

You think you know me
But you have no idea
Act like you 'bout it
Well let me put this in your ear
If you really 'bout it
Do it like a boss like you don't care
If you 'bout it, I don't doubt it
Show me that you sho'nuff 'bout it, 'bout it

I'ma get rich or I'ma die tryin'
I ain't 50 Cent, but respect my mind
Respect my gangster, respect my shine
Put your click in check if you step outta line
I ain't Kanye but I been through the wire
Couple more albums before I retire
Most of these rappers ain't nothin' but liars
Holla 'bout they killers when they sing in the choir
Straight from the bottom and I'm tryin' to get higher
Too many strikes got too many priors
Messin' with us like playin' with fire
Get your wig split, time to meet your messiah
I've seen it before in a rhyme and roll
Come and catch up with me, baby, don't stop (Don't stop)
Get to the floor, whatchu waitin' for
Cause we can ride the beat straight to the top (Straight to the top)
You waitin' too long and now it's my time
To show 'em all that it's not a game (That's its no game)
Cause I don't care what I'm lookin' like, I just gotta show you that
I'm not goin' nowhere

You think you know me
But you have no idea (No idea)
Act like you 'bout it
Well let me put this in your ear (Put this in your ear)
If you really 'bout it
Do it like a boss like you don't care (I don't care)
If you 'bout it, I don't doubt it
Show me that you sho'nuff 'bout it, 'bout it (Mmm)

Now, I've been walkin' up this road
Tryin' to find which way to go
Frown upon my face
Sometimes, it seems like I don't know
Now, I've got a chance to touch
What seems beyond my reach
And the answer's right in front of me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes it is, yeah
You think you know me
But you have no idea (You have no idea)
Act like you 'bout it
Well let me put this in your ear
If you really 'bout it ('Bout it, 'bout it)
Do it like a boss like you don't care
If you 'bout it, I don't doubt it
Show me that you sho'nuff 'bout it, 'bout it (Sho'nuff 'bout it, 'bout it)
You think you know me
But you have no idea (Oh no, no, you have no idea)
Act like you 'bout it (Hey)
Well let me put this in your ear (I'ma put this in your ear)
If you really 'bout it
Do it like a boss like you don't care (Like you don't care)
If you 'bout it, I don't doubt it
Show me that you sho'nuff 'bout it, 'bout it (Woah)
