Heh, chillin' yo
(what's up man, ya ready to go? come on!)
Naw yo, you just go ahead
(what's wrong with you man? )
(wifey got you buggin' again)
Pshh, I just don't understand, ya know
(understand what man? huh? )
She ain't talkin' to me son
(word)
Yo I need you to do me a favor yo
(what? )
You gotta call her homie
(what'chu want me to call her for)
You gotta tell her for me
(tell her what man)
That I love her so strongly
(why don't you just tell her yourself)
Cause she won't listen to me now
(damn)
Without love in my heart
I might as well be dead
(hold up, hold up, you ain't gonna be killin' yourself nigga)
So can you help me out?
You're the only one who can
Yo shorty
I just got off the phone with robbie
He told me to come talk to you
(yeah, bout what? )
He said y'all having problems
And you left him, now he's all confused
(man, so what? )
Now girl why you buggin?
You know you was made for him
And him for you
I ain't trying to butt in
I just wanna be a friend
And he asked me to call you
 - you gotta call her homie
And tell her for me
That I love her strongly
She won't listen to me
Without love in my heart
I might as well be dead
Please help me now
You're the only who can
You gotta call her homie
And tell her for me
That I'm really sorry
She won't listen to me
Without love in my heart
I might as well be dead
Please help me now
You're the only who can
Hmm, girl this thing has gone on, long enough
Can't you see
He don't know the true reason that you left him
Baby is cause of me, whoa
He would be real surprised
To find that I'm the new apple of your eye
What kind of friend am i?
To take advantage of - my best friend's trust


If you wanna know
Why I did - what I did
(tell me why did you do it)
I got tired of being alone
While you was out trickin'
(who told you I was trickin? )
I guess female dogs can learn tricks too
You see I'm not the bitch, baby payback is
And what you did came back to you, oh
