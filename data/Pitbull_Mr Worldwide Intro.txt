Vein! (Let's go)
Let's welcome everybody to Planet Pit
And show 'em what worldwide music is

They call me Mr. Worldwide
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Why you think they call me Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Hold up, 'cause bitch, I'm worldwide

I-I-I-I'm involved in the music business
But the funny thing is half of these fools don't know music
Don't know business
Have no business in music, what is this?
I learned from the best, stayed away from the worst
Now I send off every verse in a hearse
Now that every day is 15th and the 1st
No more food stamps; church
These boys can't get past third base
They a bunch of MC's searchin'
I can care less and you can give
A fat baby's ass if they car's got curtains
They rap for the block, I speak to the globe
I got them models, they holla at them hoes
Better do your homework, papito
I took the 305 worldwide
I took the 305 worldwide
Why you think they call me Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Why you think they call me Mr. Worldwide?
Let's show 'em why they call me Mr. Worldwide
Hold up, 'cause bitch, I'm worldwide
