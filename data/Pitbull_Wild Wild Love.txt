Ladies and gentlemen
You're looking at the new playboy (Who, you?)
That's right, Armando Christian Pérez
And when it comes to that pretty little bitty kitty
Don’t stop, get it, get it, baby, let me pet it
I got that wild love
Love to get wild, dirty, freaky, nasty, yeah, I said it
I'll make you lose your heart and your mind at the same time
Don't believe me, bet it
I'm obsessed with that wild love for sure
Even though it's a catch 22
It's a gift and curse for sure
But baby, you know that you love it too, that's why

You need it, you want it all over your body
This loving I'm giving, it's worth more than money
You need it, you want it all over your body
I know that you want this wild, wild, love
Oh oh, this wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
This wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
For better or worse, a blessing or a curse
Long live this wild, wild love of ours
For better or worse, a blessing or a curse
Long live this wild, wild love of ours

Not only am I a client, I'm the player president (Yeah)
The globe is my backyard, babe, it's evident
When it comes to Miami, I always represent (305!)
Read all about it, ladies and gents
I'm the chico for the game
I like my women yang, I like my women yang
I like my women fine, I like them off the chain
Take 'em all the World Cup, Brazil tudo bem
You know I'll meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em
Treat 'em, always keep them feeling right
I don't know if I can handle all five
But baby, we can try tonight, dale

You need it, you want it all over your body
This loving I'm giving, it's worth more than money
You need it, you want it all over your body
I know that you want this wild, wild, love
Oh oh, this wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
