Yeah, here we go, it's real
Hussein what's happenin', nigga? I see you
Aight, Shadoe what's poppin'? Blat! Haha, yeah
My nigga O-1 in the motherfucking house (O-1)
Jody in the house (Jody Mack)
My nigga Cadillac, Gotti what up?

I'd like to welcome all my niggas
To the world famous Murda Inc. Show
Big shout to all my Queens niggas, all my Staten Island niggas
All my Uptown niggas, all my Brooklyn niggas
All my Bronx niggas, yeah, all my Jersey niggas, you know?
We doing it real big right here (All my money niggas)
This shit commentated on the ones and twos
They call me the Mighty Rule, how ya living?
This real shit we talking
I wanna ask all my gangsta niggas a real question (Holla back)
What do you do when niggas spit at you?

Clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
Fuck what they hollerin' about Rule, nigga, here's the real
I'll pop ya top like champagne bottles to chill
With nothing but ice, now I'll send it up to the greatest
To tell 'em I'm nice too, plus push some nice coupes
The Inc. roll like deuce, man, I'm OG Bobby J
And we slinging soccer fields of yay
They don't respect that, don't get your mind around me
Get it pushed back, y'all don't want that
I send 'em to the morgue while keepin' my bitches bouncin' for sure
In the club with no gun, got 'em taking it off
Can't help that, I'm the nigga that puts it down
Once I hit that, that's it, I'm up in the mind, maxin' them
Holdin' the throwback, West, 44, Lakers
Let's make no mistakes when these F's take place
What's the procedure with a gun in your face when you got one in your waist?
Let's cock back, nigga, air out the space (C'mon), we gon'

Clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
The Rule be in the club, rude motherfucker poppin' the bubbly
When shit get ugly, I hug the snub closely
But usually used to seein' your bitches
Dancin' on some freak shit, trying to ride my dick
I can handle it long as they manage
To get they ass in front of my dick and dance to BIG's "One More Chance"
I'm catching hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These niggas is mere ants, I'll stomp 'em wit a shank
Give bitches the back hand, this pimp shit, it's not realistic
Your game is helpless, let's not get it twisted
I'm young, Black, and gifted, but still at the bottom
And stuck somewhere between Gomorrah and Sodom
I'm here to make this rap shit hotter than Harlem
Fuck the dog, we werewolves is out on the prowl
What's the procedure when you got a gun on you face when you got one in your waist?
Let's cock back, nigga, air out the space (C'mon), we gon'

Clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
Like Bush and Saddam, I'm a find out
Where Em Laden's hiding and bomb him first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than your scrubs
Mask and gloves, gun hot to burn that ass up
I'd rather be bossed up with a bunch of broads
The preacher's daughter screaming out, "Fuck the Lord!"
I may have struck a chord with the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessing to handle my business
All these wanksta snitches, let the nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress
And clap that boy like Birdman and Clipse
I got these niggas all over my dick like hoes
I'm the star at these shows, I must be as hot as they come
What's the procedure with a gun in your face when you got one in your waist?
Let's cock back, nigga, air out the space (C'mon), we gon'

Clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back
We gon' clap back, we gon' clap back (Let's take 'em to war, niggas)

Yeah, my nigga 'Zino in this motherfucker (That's how we do it, know what I mean?)
Buck '89, what's up, baby? I see you (Bust it down, nigga, break 'em down)
Bringin' birds in the motherfucking house
It's not a game no more (Queens in this motherfucker)
You know, all my Jersey niggas (All my Boston niggas)
All my Brooklyn niggas, Brooklyn, sir, what up?
Haha, yeah, holla at me, man
