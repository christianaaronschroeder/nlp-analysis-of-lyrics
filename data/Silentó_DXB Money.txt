Gucci on my shirt
On my waist
Bought a Louie Bag just in case
Cause I be getting money everyday
Took your girl out for a date
Dubai Money
Gucci, Fendi, Prada, on my face
Bought myself a ghost the other day cause I been ghostin' all the fakes

If you ain't gettin' money nigga we can't relate
Going through the fast lane without no brakes
All this sauce drippin' down my mouthafuckin' plate
I'm countin' these racks bitch i'm all about my cake

As-salamu alaykum
Silento yes I'm with it
I'm in UAE
I'm from USA yea lets get it
Bands coming in I want these millions and some billions
Counting up these trillions
I know they bе in their feelings
I ain't worry bout no haters
I just keep this foreigns
Only whеn I'm touring
Oh they adoring
In the club pop a bottle
Yea lets get it
In the section lit with the mamba Kobe fitted
Trip on me I kill it
Rollie on me with it
Stars on ceiling
Rolls Royce we the richest
Linked up with Mo Vlogs I been poppin' in his city
My name is Silento when i'm comin' they can't hear me
But I got bad shit that's filmin'
Six Dish on a whip i'm whippin'
Stay down I came straight from the trenches
Thank god that I got it i'm livin
Louie on my neck and on my wrist
I'm workin' hard so I ain't takin' no risk
