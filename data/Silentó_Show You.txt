Its a lot of pretty things I wanna tell ya
It's a lot of pretty things I wanna show ya
Its a lot of pretty things I wanna tell ya
It's a lot of pretty things I wanna show ya

I can take you out
I can show you around
Baby
I just want to show you
Baby
I just want to show you
I just want to show you

Anywhere you want to go
We can take a trip
Pulling up in the foreign
Yeah you know we dip
I been around the world
And I've seen it all
Standing tall
But I'm looking real small
Chasing copper
Steady trying to get the bundles
Doing everything for my momma
Call my phone I'm alone
When you wanna hang with me
Yeah, that's how we do it where I'm from yeah
It ain't no pressure I'm really trying to get these racks
I'm sitting back that's how I really live
That's how we do it
I get to it
Running fluid
I can take you there
I can take you out
What you wanna do
It's me and my crew
Tell me what you wanna do
It's me and my crew
Let's go
