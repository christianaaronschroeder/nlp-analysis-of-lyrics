Lately, I been in my feelings like a ho
I ain't been really havin' hope 'cause I been missin' my bro
I was at the polls in a Gucci Peacoat
Tryna tell all y'all bitch-ass niggas, "Come vote"
Damn, bruh, you aren't the only one who felt alone
I been feelin' lonely too, I probably say it every song
Lookin' at my nieces, broke me down to pieces
Cryin' at the hospital, askin' "Why you leave us?"

Lookin' at my nephew and he think his daddy breathin'
But his daddy took his life and we can't get it back, damn, nigga
Before I let you do that, would've killed a hundred niggas
Where thе fuck them hundred niggas at?
And you the rеason that your baby brother cutthroat
You the reason baby brother love gun smoke
I was playin' with your guns in the closet
Would've had a bullet and I probably would've popped it
We grew up 'round drugs, sex, poverty and violence
Wasn't hard to tell in high school you caught a body
'Cause when you walked in, I saw the way you looked at mommy
I saw everything, nigga, I'm your baby brother, nigga
And when you walked in, seen that look in your eyes
You told me that you got some demons
Told me back then that you weren't scared to die
You told me you already seen it
I was ten years old, nigga (From the moment I was ten)
You and Ri' was tryna make me be a good boy
I was tryna be my big bro, nigga (I was tryna be my big bro)
I was born in this shit, they had the hood so
Ain't nobody touch me 'cause they know, nigga (Know)
Could've talked you out that stupid ass shit, but I was busy talkin' niggas into votin', nigga
Man, fuck the President, long live G, nigga

Man, bro, I was just callin', man, just to say thank you, man
You know, uh, I ain't never seen you in the position that you in today
As a grown-ass man, as an individual
As you just bein' who you are
I ain't no better than you
But what you've given me the opportunity just to be able to live
Enjoy life, be happy, do what I'm passionate about
Although I know it really derived from God, you know what I'm sayin' like?
Bruh, thank you very fuckin' much, I love you, my nigga, I swear to God
Love you too, bruh
I don't, I don't know how much I can convey that, I don't know how much more I can say that
Love you too
You know, I made my mistakes, but for the opportunity I have right in front of me right now
Bruh, I thank you man, like for real, for real, I thank you, Jon, thank you
You welcome, bro
Mama, don't cry, your firstborn is at peace
Ain't no more shakin' all night in his sleep, he free
I love you, nigga, we miss you, nigga
Mama, don't cry, your firstborn is at peace
Ain't no more shakin' all night in the sleep, he free
