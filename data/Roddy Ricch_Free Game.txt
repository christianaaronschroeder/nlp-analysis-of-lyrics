Baby, I can’t stop until that duffel unfold
Cost your whole life just to pull up in that Rolls
I was that lil', nigga, I was whipping on the stove
Sixteen years old I was kicking in them doors

My nigga in the prison he told me some niggas told
Most niggas ain’t solid, swear it’s some niggas fold
We flooded the Patek's, the streets and build stoves
We running with the techs and cleats the field cold
They sent him to the pound for pounds my dawg gone
They searching and up the whip and I hope they don’t find the phone
I call my Piru partners and they told me slime gone
Smoking that gelato got me different time zone

I stack the Benjamins and ran it up
Know you want me for money baby, you leaving just beg me to go
I just roll up a fat one baby, you see me don’t pass me the Dutch
They call me lil bird young nigga put your wing up
Depression got a nigga dropping Xannies in the lean cup
We mud brothers these bitches can’t come between us
I just run up a sack niggas always tryna know what I'm on
I pull up in the white, no location give my dawg the phone
My nigga in the prison he told me some niggas told
Most niggas ain’t silent for instance some niggas fold
We flooded the Pateks the streets the and build stoves
We running with the techs and cleats the field cold
They sent them to the pound for pounds my dawg gone
They searching up the whip and I hope they don’t find a phone
I call my power partners and they told me slime gone
Smoking that gelato got me different time zone

Running up these hunnid on me and my niggas don’t count on the deal
See me in the streets, you breach,  just know that I keep me a steel
Lot a niggas hating tryna get my bitch to use me
Talking bout that nigga my nigga just throw on a two piece
Hop up in that Audi gotta get that bag today
Thanking God that me and all my niggas pad the same
Thanking God that I can count these hunnids in a wraith
Don't want okay, I do the race

They pray don’t find the phone
I pray don’t find the phone
Hope they don’t find the phone
We better don’t find the phone
These niggas ain’t know what I’m on
Cause I’m in a different time zone
No, no, oh, ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya
