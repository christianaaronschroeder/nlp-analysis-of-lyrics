Let me get fucked up and I’ll do whatever you want
Como

Woooo
Mr. Worldwide checking in
You know it’s history in the making
Now, mathematically this doesn’t make sense
But in this scenario, one plus one equals three
(Eeeyyyooo!)

I like her and she likes her
We gon' have a love fest
One, two, tres, ménage à trois
Let's get down to business
Back it up and drop it low
Tap that like a bongo
I like them and they like me
It takes three to tango

Ladies and ladies, I am your gentleman
I open double doors 
Now go ‘head and come in
I got that Voli305 getting live
I'm in the iLov305 getting live
So many options, so little time
A little bit of Erika with extra on the side
More and more for me (Yeah)
More and more for them (Yeah)
Switch up and then (Yeah)
Switch it back again (Yeah)
Two to one ratio
(Mmm, c’est-c’est-c’est-c’est la vie)
(Ooh la la)
Two to one ratio
Round and round and round and round we go

I like her and she likes her
We gon' have a love fest
One, two, tres, ménage à trois
Let's get down to business
Back it up and drop it low
Tap that like a bongo
I like them and they like me
It takes three to tango

Rotate
It takes three, it takes three to tango
Rotate
It takes three, it takes three to tango
(Brrrr-ow!; Tango)

My reputation is notorious
It ain’t gotta be serious
No time for mysterious
How bout’ we all get delirious
Sí mamita, tú y tu amiguita
Two to one ratio
(Mmm, c’est-c’est-c’est-c’est la vie)
(Ooh la la)
Two to one ratio
Round and round and round and round we go
(Eeeyyyooo!)

I like her and she likes her

Let's get down to business
Back it up and drop it low

It takes three to tango

Rotate
It takes three, it takes three to tango (Tango)
Rotate
It takes three, it takes three to tango (Tango)

Everybody here at the party now
Three, two, tango
Two to one ratio
One plus one equals three
Makes sense to me
Two to one ratio
Round and round and round and round we go
Round and round and round and round we go
(Eeeyyyooo!)

I like her and she likes her
