I sit in the back, you blowing me kisses
We skip out class, we meet by the benches
Walk on the track and doing detention
They think that we did, so we might as well do it
Let do it

Feels so crazy that you're my baby
I don't want to mess things up, young love
Feels so crazy that you're my baby

Girl, girl I can't let you go
That young love, young love
That young love, young love
Girl I can't let you go
Girl I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
No, I can't let you go

I play on JV
She sit at my practice
She want me to get it
When we get off campus
I go to my whip and cut on the classic
I know that you loving the tone of my voice
Girl tell me what's happening
Feels so crazy that you're my baby
I don't want to mess things up, young love
Feels so crazy that you're my baby (you my girl)

Girl I can't let you go
That young love, young love
That young love, young love
Girl I can't let you go
Girl I can't let you go

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ya!
