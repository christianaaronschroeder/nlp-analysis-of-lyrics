Hop out, drop, top, fuck y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down

Gettin' dough ain't a thing change
Coasting, grippin' grain
Goin' through the money like a phase
Don't say my name in vain
I'm so glad that you came
All these bad bitches gettin' slain
Broke ass nigga get a clue
All these niggas know how we do

Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave

Swang, now some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take a little bank
