City High-I-I, Booga Basement, here come another one, uh

I know things ain't work out for you and me lady
But don't worry about my child, cause Imma take care of 'em baby
And I can't keep comin' 'round, breakin' you off
Cause it breaks my heart, when we make love
And ain't no love involved, now tell me

Why should we screw?
If we can get along, what's the point in getting it on?
Girl, you know that it's wrong when all we do
Is sweep it under the rug
What's the point when we touch if we're no longer in love?

This makes no sense to do what we do
Cause baby I've been moved on and I know you got someone new
So we promised each other we wouldn't make this a sexual thing
Cause it feels good while we bang, but when it's all over
You know we'll be fightin' again

Why should we screw?
If we can get along, what's the point in getting it on? (Ohh, yeah)
You know that it's wrong when all we do (So wrong, so wrong)
Is sweep it under the rug (You know it is)
What's the point when we touch if we're no longer in
Why, tell me why it seems to be
The only time you work with me
Is when we're in between the sheets
When I'm workin your body, that's when we get along (Yeah)
But when you put your clothes back on
Right back to the same old song
We got it all wrong....
(Play that thing Robby)


Why should we screw?
If we can get along, what's the point in getting it on?
You know that it's wrong when all we do
(It's not fair, actin like you care)
Is sweep it under the rug
What's the point when we touch if we're no longer in (Oh yeah)
Why should we screw?
If we can get along, what's the point in getting it on?
You know that it's wrong when all we do (All the wrong reasons)
Is sweep it under the rug (Our feelings, feelings, feelings)
What's the point when we touch if we're no longer in love?
(Yeah, yeah baby)
