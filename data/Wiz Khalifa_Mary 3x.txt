Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm drivin'
Gettin' higher than the Bee Gee's, sayin' we both just stayin' alive and
Watchin' the time go by, climbin'
Told you Iâ€™d get enough hash, to make a mountain
And you could sit right on your ass, doubtin'
While I'm somewhere rollin' up grass, going up where the clouds is
Some niggas say they get so high that I ain't fuckin' wit' em'
I say if them niggas got that high man I ain't fuckin' wit' em'
Doing nothin' wit' em, rollin' up or puffin wit em'
Goin' on the road, doin' shows or gettin' ducats wit' em'
I been smokin' in my pictures since Myspace
You niggas extra-curricular, bitch I fly straight

Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing
Homie I'm straight (homie I'm straight)
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going out I'm goin' the same way

All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm rappin'
And my homies smoke like I smoke so we both just make it happen
Niggas sayin' they be smokin', they be actin'
Cause you ain't yet really smoked unless you smoked one with the captain
High as fuck, choked up in my cabin
Got some OG from a fan and it was rolled up in a napkin
So we Taylored, all my niggas smoke papers
Never smokin' that bullshit with them fucked up names and them flavors
I remember puttin' weed in my videos, niggas thought I was insane
Now every time I turn on a video, I see the exact same thing
Cause niggas ain't original, niggas ain't cool
You niggas ain't got it naw, you niggas just ain't you
That shit is a problem for a nigga who can't lose
Lil homie I gotta ball, its something you can't do
So suckas hate

Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing
Homie I'm straight (homie I'm straight)
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going out I'm goin' the same way

All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
I think Kush & OJ obviously is the one that broke you
To the consciousness. So people expect that from you
So it feels like, almost, homage to that but next level
Like the beat by Spaceghostpurrp takes it next level
The way the Seldgren's changing the sound a little bit
Takes it next level production-wise
And then you take it, next level
I'm glad you fuck with it
And that's what it's all about
Taking it to the next level
Elaborating on what we've done
Because a lot of people
They've elaborated on what we've done
