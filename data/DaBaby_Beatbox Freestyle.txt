Best motherfuckin' rapper, nigga
This Baby, nigga, let's go

Ready to get it started, nigga (Go)
Whenever you want it
I was the man with the plan since a shawty
Pull up to the Grammy Awards with my .40 (Damn E, this shit exclusive)
She told me she like how I'm dressin' and I ain't eatin' no salad (Uh-huh)
Stevie Wonder can see that I'm havin'
I told her, "Be patient," she waited
I gave her the dick, she walked out doin' the "Beat Box Challenge"
Like yeah, get in thеre, baby (Get in therе)
You know me, hit you anywhere, baby (Let's go)
Know she gon' do whatever I say
I could piss in a cup, call it lemonade, baby
Let that bitch off, I'm a renegade, baby
I'ma get outta there, I ain't feelin' that (Huh?)
Nigga run up on me with a cellphone out
He gon' fuck around, die on the internet (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Fuck it, kill him on IG Live
Let the whole world see the nigga die (Die)
Yeah, shout-out to SpotEm', we got 'em (Get down)
Even though he a rapper, he shot him
I get this big pretty-ass smile from my mama (Cheese)
Get this motherfuckin' voice from my daddy
I learned how to pimp on them hoes from my uncle (Pimp, pimp)
Let her suck on my toes 'cause I'm nasty (Okay)
Like fuck it, she asked me to do it
Play with me, I'ma actually shoot you
Most of these niggas be cap and we knew it
These niggas drop shit and we laugh at they music
I know how to murder these niggas with kindness
Fuckin' they bitch from the back, how I do it
I buy a Cuban and fill it with diamonds
Send my assistant to pick up some condoms
Instagram model at the hotel textin' me now
Want me to give her the Johnson
Damn, that nigga Baby on fire and it won't go out
They know that lil' nigga's a problem
Got a big .45 on decock (Go)
Usin' big words like I'm T.I. (Turn up)
Don't wanna get me started, nigga
Turn me up, niggas gon' see why
Nigga, you a bitch, JoJo Siwa (Bitch)
You let the wrong nigga get rich
Both of these chains on my neck, they compete with each other
They fightin' and throwin' a fit
Know how these hoes like to argue and beef with each other
She fightin' now, over the dick
You should already know you ain't searchin' DaBaby
'Cause that nigga like to come in with the stick
I don't like to get into the mix (No)
I done got paid in full, my nigga
I get them hoes like I'm Mitch
Even got white people all on my dick (Go)
Yeah, second year, six-time Grammy-nominated
Came through turnt up, everybody hated
Before I had my first M, it was Billion Dollar Baby
He bet the house and his self like Las Vegas (Go)
You want the shit? Gotta earn it
He off the leash, he don't think he can get murdered
Know how to swim, so I fuck with who fuckin' with me
I take a bridge and I burn it
Let me see if you can swim, lil' nigga
Shit gettin' out of hand, I just parked a new Benz
Hopped in a new Benz, lil' nigga (Let's go)
And Ion't want new friends
(That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby)
Yeah, yeah, they say they want that old shit back, you know (Said that, make that, stand on that)
I told 'em, don't get me started, nigga
They say they want that Baby Jesus, put me in that mode (Yeah, get that Baby Jesus)
You know, I'm tryna enjoy this bread (Go)
You know, be fancy and shit, be mainstream and shit, you know, you know? (Fasho)
They said I went commercial, like I still won't come up off the hip and hurt you
Bitch ass nigga
Aight, man, it's 6:55 in the mornin', man, shit
