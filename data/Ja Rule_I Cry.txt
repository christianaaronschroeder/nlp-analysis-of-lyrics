Said we cry, cry, cry, we cry together, oh, oh

When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

I love my life, I love my wife, a bad time to prevail
It overwhelmed me, I'm livin' in hell but livin' wealthy
And know these hoes love me because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Get me some bottles of that Remi Martin, let's get the party
Cracking right here, fuck V.I.P.Â 
Knowing my baby loves me, home with tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin' her lies
She ain't surprised at me, she just surprised that we
Been together for this long and I can be
The one to mistreat her, thought it'd last forever
'Cause if I cry, you cry, we cry together

When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
From what I recall, we was little niggas
Cuttin' school, gettin' high with the hottest bitches
Livin' life so free, that we ain't fearin' the
Ills of the world and the heat of drug dealin'
You and I then made a killin', and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever a tie this close
Not the love between us, but your love for the dough
You went O.T., started makin' M-O-N-E, why
All my good niggas gotta die?
But shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
'Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

Wash away your tears, my love
You ain't gotta cry no more, my love
I put it on everything that I love
That my pain is my love
And I want this world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear, 'cause a nigga died happily
My mama warned me life was a motherfucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin'
And every night she just looked at me, tears in her eyes
And they be saying shit like, "I don't want me baby to die"
Brought so much pain to her life, gotta make it better
'Cause when ma cried, I cried, we cried together

When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

Ooh, you cry, then I cry, then we cry
When he cries, I cry, together, together
When I cry, then you cry, then we'll cry together
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, baby
'Cause when Ja cries, Mo cries, we'll cry together
If he cry, then I'll cry, then we'll cry together, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Mm, oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, woah, oh, woah
