I'm eating like Big Nick
Silento
Ooh oh oooh

You determined to get it you know I got you shawty
Don't worry about bitches you know I don't bother
And they got my number and I don't never call em
Cause when we stop talking they always bringing problems
I don't give a fuck no I ain't with that drama
I'm too independent you know I'm going hard
Live my life from the bottom you know we going up
I know they gone hate it cuz they ain't stopping none

Alot of shit ain't the same no more
I won't change (Oh no) remain the same (Humble)
Because I been through it all (Yеa)
Steady catching them bags (Yea) Solo
Ain't no switching up for famе you know that I stay true to this
Diamonds they shining she know that she foreign
I party at night and we up until the morning
I'm drinking I'm making em drive the boat
Who's the captain it's Silento
No ain't no limit here minimum 100 on every chain
I do the dash in everything back to back with it
In foreign things I'm switching lanes
Exhaust I pass counting up hunnas and pocket change
This is my life and I made it rain
When I start singing the weather change
Counting up hunnas and pocket change
This is my life and I made it (Sang)
You determined to get it you know I got you shawty
Don't worry about bitches you know I don't bother
And they got my number and I don't never call em
Cause when we stop talking they always bringing problems
I don't give a fuck no I ain't with that drama
I'm too independent you know I'm going hard
Live my life from the bottom you know we going up
I know they gone hate it cause they ain't stopping none

Babe, I can see the bigger picture break it down
I'm into the building
You won't catch me ever tripping about my future nigga
I ain't got time to bullshit around with a pussy nigga
Knowing I can't trust too many love it when they lurking for me
In the palace counting money success stay coming running to me
Over stand my whole journey spirited guided (Going through it)
At the top (I'm riding through it) with all this time (I'm down for it)
Never look back (No regrets)
Yeah I had to do it don't worry too much
My life is to rough I ain't got to rush
So don't say none showed you the world
Now you traveling girl expensive lifestyle
We living it yeah go to the mall and we ball through the year
Holding my hand while you fall on my ear
I could be different I won't disappear
Calling you queen cause I'm a king
You determined to get it you know I got you shawty
Don't worry about bitches
You know I don't bother (Don't Worry About Shit)
And they got my number and I don't never call em
Cause when we stop talking they always bringing problems (Fr fr)
I don't give a fuck no I ain't with that drama
I'm too independent you know I'm going hard
Live my life from the bottom you know we going up
I know they gone hate it cause they ain't stopping none
