Yeah, yeah
I know you feeling the sound
Yeah eh eh eh
In L.A we be rolling that shit
Crusing the sunset strip looking for chicks
Most girls you see be looking good
But they attitude is so Hollywood
I can like a nigga, gotta impress ya’ll
Bitch I seen you, uh you live on crenshaw
Girl You so fine, push your standards aside
You can jump in my ride and I’ll show you a good time
I know a club around the way that be poppin’ fo sho
So gather up your girlfriends cause we all fitin ta roll
There’s more booties than seats so just sit on my lap
And the rest of ya’ll ladies, ya’ll can fit in the back
Rollin up with the car packed, a wee booty and booze
In the club my nigga red foo’s are the ones and twos
Feelin like the man of the hour to the flow we cruise
It’s hard to dance baby
Why?
Cause I’m watching you, so just
(Chorus)
Get on down, get on down girl
Get on down, I know you feelin’ the sound (x3)
Get on down (x5)
Now who got the kush, and who got the swisha nigga
Roll it up, come on roll it up quicka
I gotta puff puff pass, puff puff pass
A girl just walked passed with a nice round ass
So excuse me I gotta go fuck up the rotation I know
But when I see a booty like that my other heads in control
On the dance floor again, she droppin it low again
Booty so big it look like two obese salsa twins
Oh my god, is this a fucked song
You lookin so good, got a nigga in awe
Baby baby please come back home with me
She drop it low, turned around then she agreed
“I know you ain’t thinking that I’m getting on my knees”
What! Girl you know you better
Get on down, get on down girl
Get on down, I know you feeling the sound (x3)
Get on down (x3)
