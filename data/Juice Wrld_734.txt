Off-White on the G-Fazo's
Her love's dead, think it needs a halo
I'm in my head, dammit, I think too much
Now I'm getting tear stains on the bankrolls
Bro said if she wanna leave, I should let go
Heart saying, "If she leave, we're going with her, let's go"
I don't wanna let go, girl from seven-three-four

Time, time heals all wounds
But time can leave the nastiest scars
This happened too soon
I'm starting to think I don't know who you are
Pills get popped as your love gets stopped
You just sit and watch as I wheeze and cough
I can't breathе at all, I can't breathe it off
I can't breathе with all the pain involved

Heart saying, "If she leave, we're going with her, let's go"
I don't wanna let go, girl from seven-three-four
In the studio getting high with the bros
Eyes get big when I see you're texting my phone
Codependent, yeah, I hate being alone
And everyone knows
Now I got to deal with this rain again
The same rain that you made go away (That you made go away)
Now I gotta deal with this heart-throbbin' pain again
The pain feel like it never go away (Never go away)
Girl, never say you can't forgive me for my mistakes
You do things to make me ache, but I love you so much, I'll wait
For however long it takes
