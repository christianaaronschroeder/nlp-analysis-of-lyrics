Ahh!

I shake, I move, the girl get hot
I shake, I move, and the girl get hot
I shake, I move, and the girl get hot
I shake, I move, I shake, I move, and girl get hot

Walk in the club, with that attitude
That I’m in love, girl I’m in love with you
I’m on the floor and I bust my moves
You getting horny, you cannot control you
Hey girly, girl
Give me your bootay
Let me slap it
Like I was your daddy
She, she wants me badly
'Cause I’m what they not

I shake, I move
I shake, I move
And then the girl get hot
Okay, lets play a game to see who can do it
Move like a maniac mane, off the fluid
Attitude, lose it, this ain’t a scene
It’s a dance floor, baby it’s a dance floor
I'm on the dance floor, light it up like a candle (What?)
(He on the dance floor light it up like a candle)

Ya bitch, even though I’m rich, I ain’t afraid to act like a fool
Like a motherfuckin kid, there it is

I shake, I move, and the girl get hot
I shake, I move, and the girl get hot


Alright
Ohh
Alright
Ohh
Alright
