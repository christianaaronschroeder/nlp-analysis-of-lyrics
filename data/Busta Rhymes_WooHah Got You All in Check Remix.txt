Woo-Hah!! Got you all in check

Busta Rhymes up in the place with the ODB
Busta Rhymes you rhyme dirty, you rhyme after me
The ODB was nominated for a Grammy
Congratulations Bust with your solo LP
Putting scratches in my lyrics like my name was Kid Capri
Blow up the spot, regardless of your nationality
And I'm the Dirty Dawg can't fuck with me
This...this...this NUH took Mariah on a fantasy
I had a wet dream that I was bonin Jody Wately
Doin wild shit a nuh ain't allowed to see
But we about to blow up the spot momentarily
Woo-Hah! Ran stupid all throughout the country
And for youse to kill me? That wasn't meants to be
I know it feel good, motherfuckers want the recipe
And whose the vigilante, in the place to be
The ODB, Busta Rhymes real quality
My top priority, is to be the voluntarily
Nigga that rip your ass for free, ha-hah-hah, hah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Ohh baby I like it raw, get with me
Baby it's pure ecstasy
Yo everytime I design a flow, you see in 3D
Flawless victory knock a nigga out, one two three!

Dibby dabby dibbi dah, then I pass a lot
Let me get more hot, represent the spot
A mad Squad when it comes to the art of rapping
I gotta keep your hands clapping
When you look at me, the type of guy I be
I'm a dirty dancer, making girlies panties move
Let them fly so I can blast up the twat
Girlies watch sayin "God, stop getting me hot!"
Niggas talk shit, yo kill the yapping
Word is bond baby, tell me how you look so smashing
Now I got your head hurt, you need an aspirin
Bashin your head in the wall, time for some action
If you want a small piece well here's a fraction
Of shit that will bust your head quick, peep the transaction
Of how we keep motherfuckers constantly crashing
They flyest whips, think no shifts, now whose the champion?
I bring the wicked flow, like the latest fashion
Satisfaction baby keep your camera flashing
I was busting the sperm cells mixed with Old Gold
Fungus mold, 'fore-you-should-list slum gold
Played for a wild Irish rose
Fat ass nigga, slim bitch with no clothes
In the backseat of a 'back sixty-nine Oldsmoz
Are your soles and toes in the windows? Oh my hoes!
Hey believe me when I say so
You're in need ofarealnig-c-ca-ca-ca-crambone
