Straight off the rip, you know I don't wait for the drop (Off the rip)

You know BDB ENT, we gon' pull up Infinitis, Challengers, Chargers (Okay)
And no, we don't gotta get money with you, bitch, we gon' get money regardless (Huh)

Don't get me started, you know I'ma stop it (Go 'head and talk)
And I don't got a cent for a ho
She bringin' up money, I'm changin' the topic (Huh, huh)
She need to be talkin' 'bout suckin' some dick

We havin' revolvers strictly for murder and plenty of pistols and choppers (Clack, clack)
Ayy, when you gon' stop?
Whenever the fat lady sing, I don't listen to opera (Ooh, ooh)
You know how I give it up
Fuck around, fucked up my hand, beat a nigga up
Pull off on a nigga like vroom

So she in the club with her ass and her titties out (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
And we done robbed so many plugs
You better check and go ask what my city 'bout

Wanted to fuck me but I only hit her mouth (No cap)
Take the palm of my hand, slap me a nigga
Got somethin' to say, make 'em spit it out
You knowin' 'bout Baby
All the shit that nigga rappin' 'bout, that nigga really 'bout
And no, I ain't takin' advice from a nigga
I'm cool on that, I got it figured out
These niggas be cryin' 'bout petty shit
I can't relate because I took a bigger loss
And these niggas know I been a boss
Ever since Rick Ross was the biggest boss (Yeah, yeah)
Got diamonds all over my teeth

Hold my watch in the air
It's no longer hot, you can go turn the condition off
I'm hittin' this ho on the low
She fuck with me hard, she say that her nigga soft (Huh)
Why you talkin' so low?
'Cause if a nigga find out and he try me, I'm knockin' a nigga off
I'm ridin' past 12, flyin' through fast as hell, flickin' a nigga off (Vroom, vroom)
I'm revin' the gas, burnin' out on niggas' ass, I'm showin' my engine off (Hah)
Hahaha
And that's just how the fuck I get down, man, you know I just be playin' sometimes
Like right now, like, I'm just fuckin' 'round, you know
Me and kid, you know, we up in the penthouse, you know, kickin' shit
And, uh, I'm still the best rapper

Straight off the rip, you know I don't wait for the drop (Off the rip)
I go out to eat with my kids and my mama, you know I ain't datin' no thot (Okay, let's go)
Believe what you see, nigga
I can't name a rapper that's out here and breathin' that's fuckin' with me, nigga
