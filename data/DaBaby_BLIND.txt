Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been blind for a while now

I just got the key, they let me in, no ID
Doors openin' up for me and now I see
I've been blind for a while now
I've been blind for a while now (Ayy, I've been blind, hey)

Every single goddamn day, a nigga think he next to leak it (Next to who?)
Tomatoes, mustard, mayonnaise
Nigga better catch up, catch up, catch up, catch up (Yup, yup, yup)
Thankful that my head too hard for me to learn my lesson (My head too goddamn hard)
'Cause the way I did it worked out fine, ooh, God you blessed me (Amen)
Probably ain't believe me
Know a nigga went through hell and back, now he finally on the TV (Yeah)
Now a nigga don't even give a fuck no more, probably think it's easy
Let you know it ain't easy
I fuck her like a Bathing Ape, she run from the dick like a cheetah (Go)
Two-tone AP watch on, never see me use it for a clock (Tick, tock)
They see the way he fuckin' up the charts (Hmm)
I wonder is he ever gon' stop?
And he charge a hundred-fifty for the verses now
Pay it or he never ever drop
They noticed that a nigga music versatile
Wonder if he ever goin' pop? (Go)
I just got the key, they let me in, no ID
Doors openin' up for me and now I see
I've been blind for a while now (Blind)
I've been blind for a while now (Blind)
Let's go
I just got the key, they let me in, no ID
Doors openin' up for me and now I see
I've been blind for a while now
I've been blind for a while now

Yeah
I've been quarantined, livin' with my kiddies
Tryna teach me how to cha-cha, woah
Fucked around, left the door open
Now they know that they can't stop me
Don't place me in no cop car
Yeah, I'm off probation, so it's gas I blow
I found love in my bitch, so I don't ask no more
I can really sit back, ain't gotta pass no dough
All of my brothers get loot, I don't got ride with pistols (Yeah)
They found him dead, he dissed you (Woah)
PTDS, don't you tell me you lost me (Woo)
Fuck all the rest, none them bitches are a nominee
Go to the head whenever dogs with me die
Got me riding 'til the sun come, blood on my white 1's
I just got the key, they let me in, no ID
Doors openin' up for me and now I see
I've been blind for a while now (Blind)
Yeah, I've been blind for a while now, yeah (Let's go)
I just got the key, they let me in, no ID
Doors openin' up for me and now I see
I've been blind for a while now
I've been blind for a while now (Yeah)
