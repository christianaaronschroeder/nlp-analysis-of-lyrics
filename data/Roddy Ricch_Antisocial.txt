Lyrics from Snippets

... you know
I got the brand new ride, hope I don't crash
I've been tryna find your love
Please excuse me, I'm so antisocial (Yeah, yeah)
I'm antisocial

I gotta work on my words don’t bring it through social media
Heard that chick being solo, I fuck it, stroke it deep (Ayy)
I’ve been learning your tendencies and ain’t got no teacher (Ayy)
I put Xanax, Percocet inside my two liter (Ayy)
You know I did it, I’m so fast, like a cheetah
Yeah, yeah, what would you do to destroy me?
I was tryna treat you like some royalty (Yeah, yeah)
If I was broke, would you take on the lawyer fee?
I just got a bag and shoot up (Woo)
I just wanna go straight to Pluto
Got a red nose like Rudolph
My pockets big, sumo
I had the drive in the high school, I ain't fuck with Ju-Co, yeah
'Cause you know, you know (Let's go)

... you know
I got the brand new ride, hope I don't crash
I've been tryna find your love
Please excuse me, I'm so antisocial
I'm antisocial
