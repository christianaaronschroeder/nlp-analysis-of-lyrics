Wait a minute, who are you? (Ayy, yo, K.i.D.)

Baby, these bitch ass niggas ain't crazy
Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby
(Hold on, Lil Top, talk to 'em, nigga)
And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' (Talk back)
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it (Bling)
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' (Let's go)
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin'

She say I look good, bitch, I been doin' pushups
Play with Baby and Top, nigga, good luck
My lil' daughter two, but got six figures put up
Knock his head off his neck 'fore he look up
Ten toes in they chest for a check, bitch, I stood up (What that mean?)
I stood up on they neck for a check (Uh-huh)
Now my head get 'em stressed, I'm a vet

Put that stick to your face, screamin' out 4KTrey
From the north of Baton Rouge to Atlanta

I be runnin' my city, the police don't like it
They know we be steppin' on shit (Steppin' on shit)
Put that blick on your brother, you feelin' some way
Make him hot, tell him dig up the bitch (Dig up the bitch)
Shoot two hundred, bet one, how you livin', lil' nigga?
You know I be havin' this shit (Stupid lil' nigga)
Paranoid every day, I be feelin' some way
When you bring up the static and shit

Switch the channel, we fixin' that static (Let's switch)
Give a nigga a clip, he can have it
Get to hittin' so quick, they think it's automatic (Boom, boom, let's go)
Nigga gon' try to hide in the house
Get his ass to come out, hit his bitch ass in traffic (Like boom)
Made a song in ten minutes, went platinum
Know we still with the shits, send a hit, we get active (Yeah)
Mention YB and Baby, the game in the padlock (Yeah)
My lil' bitch got that ass with no waist, pretty face
A six-pack, niggas think she got ass shots
I hit her from the back 'til we pass out (Uh-huh)
I Kurt Angle that ho, put her leg in the air, ankle lock
Hold that bitch 'til she tap out (Bitch)
Be one deep on your street with that strap out (One deep)
Fuck a rapper, let's see what that rack 'bout
Got a brand new pistol, nigga
I make it jump like, like crack in the '80s
Baby, these bitch ass niggas ain't crazy
Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby
(Hold on, Lil Top, talk to 'em, nigga)
And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' (Talk back)
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it (Bling)
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' (Let's go)
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin'

Mic check, one-two, check one, stretch two
When it come to murder, you know how we do
When I walk in this bitch, keep your hands to yourself
It go down, shoot it up, spin again in a coupe (Bang, bang)
When you come to my house, you see everything new
You probably'll find a strap in every room
I went bought me a Rollie on top of this Patek
But, bitch, it ain't on, I'ma jump out with two
Shorty say she on me, yeah
We be on her ass soon as I walk in the room
Nigga don't know me, yeah, we be on his ass
Stalk him all through the day to the moon
Street nigga, I don't never pick and choose
I be totin' on somethin' make all them bitch niggas move (Pussy)
Soon as we run down, we gon' dirt him
You know it ain't certain, we never be leavin' no clues, nigga
Hold on, I'm Lil Top, nigga, believe that

I make it jump like, like crack in the '80s
Baby, these bitch ass niggas ain't crazy
Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby

And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' (Talk back)
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it (Bling)
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' (Let's go)
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin'

I make it jump like I'm Giannis (Just honest)
Tryna see how it feel from behind her (Let's go)
Know that lil' bitch ain't shit, don't deserve to suck dick
Make that bitch give me head with a condom (Uh-huh)
Wanna gamble and crap out, let's get it
We put racks on his motherfuckin' cap like a fitted (No cap)
Baby pull up 2020, hop out like it's nothin'
That lil' nigga stuntin', he shittin' (Vroom)
I get high by myself in the skybox (Yeah)
I came out the house, two F&N's for the day (Two)
Why you bring 'em both out? Nigga, why not? (Why?)
Let 'em go like a pro, let 'em try now (Let's try)
I can't go like a ho, I'ma bond out (Bitch)
Send my bro, up the score, let 'em find out (Up)
Pick my boo up from school and we sign out (Mwah)
Any ho that get rude gettin' timeout, talk to 'em, nigga

I make it jump like, like crack in the '80s
Baby, these bitch ass niggas ain't crazy
Broke ass, ASCAP go straight to my baby
(Hold on, Lil Top, talk to 'em, nigga)
And I'll make my bitch talk to me when we fuckin' (Talk back)
Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it (Bling)
Big Glock on my hip, I'm clutchin' (Let's go)
Get lost on a bitch, ain't nothin', bitch
