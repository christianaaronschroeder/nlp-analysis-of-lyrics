Kissin' on my jewels, fuck a nigga out his shirt
No time for holdin' hands, she holdin' my worth
Baby pop that pussy in everything but a Perc'
I'm lovin' her good, makin' sure she never hurt
She lickin' my wood, never too classy to slurp

Young flossy nigga, she know I'm in my Birk' (My Birk')
She zippin' down my pants, I'm takin' off her shirt (Her shirt)
Kissin' on my neck (My neck), liftin' up her skirt (Her skirt)
