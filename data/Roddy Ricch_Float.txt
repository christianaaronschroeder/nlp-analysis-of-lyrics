Think of my life when pour up a sill
Float through the night I could pour up a pill
And my love don't need no force if it's real (OG Parker)
Got a lot of problems to fill my life I can't even deal
Climb up a hill, I'm like Jack and Jill
My double cup a cup I pour a sill
Nigga, I went night night on the floor for real
I wasn't boxing inside the gym but I'm a heavyweight

Update the Maybach today
I sip a cup to the face
She wanna make love on my face
I had to take care of my momma's bills
I started rapping without a deal
Bitches start calling when I got the cake
She got a bag and her booty, it shake
I got emerald diamonds, VVS in the face
Member nights, we was running from the jay (jay jay)
Tryna spin this block till we satisfied
Cause I watched my brother died
It's so normal, I can't even cry

She saw it and see it didn't change the mind
