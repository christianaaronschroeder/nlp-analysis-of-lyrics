I don't know nothin' but hoes
I don't know nothin' but take off their clothes
I like it when she get up on the pole
I gotta order a bottle of rose
I got hoes, I got O's
Get 'em wet, get 'em froze
Keep on bouncin' on that pole
Come with me, I'll take your soul
You come with me, I got the dough
You come with me on the road
You come with me, I'm in that pussy
You come with me, I'll take your soul
You come with me, I got the ice
You come with me, you pay the price
You come and you get it tonight
I'll make you have a goodnight

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh
Ooh, wait, yeah
Get out my way, get out my way
Everyone, move, get out my way
They tried to shelve me, had to go get the K
Thank God I'm wealthy, I can pay anyway
This ain't a diss, but I'm feelin' a way
I sold 20 million singles, I stack them up like they Pringles
As soon as I walk in the place, got bitches that ready to mingle
She put it all in my face, she said her pussy, it tingle
I had iron the board, cause some of these niggas be wrinkles

I don't know nothin' but hoes
I don't know nothin' but take off their clothes
I like it when she get up on the pole
I gotta order a bottle of rose
I got hoes, I got O's
Get 'em wet, get 'em froze
Keep on bouncin' on that pole
Come with me, I'll take your soul
You come with me, I got the dough
You come with me on the road
You come with me, I'm in that pussy
You come with me, I'll take your soul
You come with me, I got the ice
You come with me, you pay the price
You come and you get it tonight
I'll make you have a goodnight
Wait, ah

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
