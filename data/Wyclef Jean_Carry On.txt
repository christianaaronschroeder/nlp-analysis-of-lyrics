Ladies and gents
Tune in
To the sound of Wyclef
And Emeli Sandé

Has your heart fell in love with the sad songs?
Have your feet fell in love with the edge?
Is hope hanging on by a thread now?
Does it feel like the angels are dead?
When the darkness is too dark to handle
And the bridge won't stop calling your name
Before you blow out any candles
Oh, let the chorus play

Carry on, carry on, carry on (He said)
Carry on, carry on, carry on
Won’t be long, won’t be long, won’t be long (He said)
Carry on, carry on, carry on

When the angel of death blows the horn
And all earthly possessions are gone
What was once no longer belong
Love is a crown made of thorns
When the eyes of lies see naked truth
And the man of war, ask for a truce
Only then will love conquer hate's feud
And the world will once again will be new

Carry on, carry on, carry on (She said)
Carry on, carry on, carry on
Won’t be long, won’t be long, won’t be long (She said)
Carry on, carry on, carry on
Carry on, carry on, carry on (He said)
Carry on, carry on, carry on
Won’t be long, won’t be long, won’t be long (He said)
Carry on, carry on, carry on

La, la la la, la la la la la
La, la la la, la la la la
Yeah, keep going, keep going, keep going
Don't you give up now
Keep going, keep going, keep going
We gon' work it out
We gon' work it out, I said
We gon' make it out
We gon' make it out here
Carry on, carry on, carry on (He said)
Carry on, carry on, carry on
Won’t be long, won’t be long, won’t be long (He said)
Carry on, carry on, carry on
Carry on, carry on, carry on (He said)
Carry on, carry on, carry on
Won’t be long, won’t be long, won’t be long (We said)
Carry on, carry on, carry on
