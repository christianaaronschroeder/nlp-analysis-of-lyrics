Chris Brown, set it off (Woo!)

Oh, feeling crazy
The moon is up, the night is hazy
Let's get lost in the shadows
Somewhere we can go where no one else can find

Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone

Oh my my, looking like a good-good time
Don't disguise, the way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight, have a little F.U.N., fun (Woo!)

Fresh from Monaco, performin' for Microsoft
Miami to L.A., G4, we takin' off (Woo)
I'm a hard worker, I'm far from the boss
But when it's said and done, I'm ownin' it all (Oh)
I know you think it’s just rap (Huh, huh)
Just this, just that, haha, right (Huh)
Nah, baby, this my life
Wanna have fun for a night? Then just (Woo!)
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone

Oh my my, looking like good-good time
Don't disguise, the way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight, have a little F.U.N., fun (Woo!)

Go headlinin' on tour with Enrique
Often Casa Campo, who would've thought de que
Down in Key Largo, you know I'm on that sticky
Icky, icky, icky, icky
Don't do it much, but when I do, I'm gone
Don't take it all off, keep your heels and thong (Yeah)
Ah Mamì, that turns me on
Now just listen to the song, and (Woo!)

Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
Oh my my, looking like good-good time
Don't disguise, the way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight, have a little F.U.N., fun

Come on, Mami, you know what it is
Come on, baby, you know what it is
I wanna, uh, let's go to the crib
And if you want, you can bring your friends
Come on, Mami, you know what it is
Come on, baby, you know what it is
I wanna, uh, let's go to the crib
And if you want, you can bring your friends
And we can F.U.N., fun
Let's go, let's ride, let's show 'em how we do it in the 305

Loosen up your body 'til you come undone (Now do it, baby)
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone
(What happens in Miami, never happens)
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body, baby, come undone (F.U.N., fun, haha)
