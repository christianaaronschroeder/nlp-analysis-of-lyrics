Met her in high school way back in 99
Just a little slim dude playin' ball
She went to school led the performin' academy
For actors, singin, and whatever else that could be
She used to tell me she’s going to be famous
I said good, just remember what my name is
Don't act funny when you get that money
Cuz best believe I'mma have a couple stacks Honey
But I messed up, left her for a quick cut
Unless you’re really confident that the Grammy’s getting pick up
I tried to get her to become my Fiance
But she’s too busy partying with Beyonce
Out shopping with Rihanna and Keri
Same babysitter as Halle Berry
Couple dudes heard now she's back at my

Hey famous Girl, you know who you are
You have everything you need if you got with me
You shine so bright, you are my star

You have everything you need if you got with me
If you got with me
