I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to **** with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, and I see the reason why
Baby, you livin' the life, but baby, you ain't livin' right

Champagne and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not phased, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buyin'
I wanna feel on your **** in Hawaii
I want the jet lag from **** and flyin'
Put a smile on your mouth while I'm ****
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the **** that's in my league
I only want the ones I envy, I envy

Champagne and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not phased, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like
Oh, call me by your name (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
Told me you loved me in private
Call me by your name (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
I do not care if you lyin'
