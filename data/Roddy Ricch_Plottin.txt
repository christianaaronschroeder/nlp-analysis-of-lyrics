They been plottin' on a nigga so you know I gotta keep that thing on me
I’m never on my lonely
Plottin' on a nigga so you know I gotta keep that thing on me
Bussin' down like a Rollie
Plottin' on a nigga so you know I got to keep a lil' ratchet
You know I gotta have it
Forty with the beam so a young nigga keep it like a bad bitch
Stuffin' hunnids in the mattress

They been plottin' on a nigga
They been plottin' on a nigga
But I’m plottin' on a figure, get the picture lil nigga
I been rollin' with my gang, tryna put on for my team
Roddy Ricch off some rich player shit
For the green, for the guap
Keep plottin', don’t stop me
Gun bust down like a watch
Please stay in your lane
And to be a street nigga you don’t gotta gang bang
But I’ma do it for the hood, though
Yeah, it's for the hood though
Yeah this shit could take me out the hood though
And she give me top like a hood ho
The only thing she good for

Tell me, "KB just relax, sip your Act 'cause I'm finna throw it back"
I can't be all them stacks in the strip club

Probably never pick up unless it's for a bag
I’ma do the fucking dash, got my craft on smash
Stop playin' with me
They been plottin' on a nigga so you know I gotta keep that thing on me
I’m never on my lonely
Plottin' on a nigga so you know I gotta keep that thing on me
Bussin' down like a Rollie
Plottin' on a nigga so you know I got to keep a lil' ratchet
You know I gotta have it
Forty with the beam so a young nigga keep it like a bad bitch
Stuffin' hunnids in the mattress

You ain't plottin' on a nigga
Roll up, drop on a nigga

You know I been getting guap on these niggas, ayy

Young niggas put you on a shirt, nigga

But it’s okay 'cause I'm a cash the whip

Plottin' on a nigga so you know I got to keep a lil' ratchet
You know I gotta have it
Forty with the beam so a young nigga keep it like a bad bitch
