(Chorus)
IF your happy and u know it clap your hands
And if you like romeo clap your hands
If you like nolimit soldiers clap your hands
If you like p.miller clap your hands
If you like my little sister clap your hands you know you like our label

We eat french toast all the way at france and were with u.s. so f**k iraq and
If all yalls like romeo clap yo god dam hands and if you like me u only have
One homie Alex Martinez a.k.a Nene so if you like us clap your hands
