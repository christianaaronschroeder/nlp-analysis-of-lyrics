When I talk it, I live it, they feel it (Hah)
And I got a pretty bitch with a fat ass
Put one leg in the air when I hit it (Ha-ha-ha-ha, Firzt on the track)
The police behind me, you know that I'm smashing
I ain't pulling over, you tripping (Vroom, vroom)
But I ain't tryna talk about police
Let's talk 'bout bitches, let's talk 'bout business (Okay)
Let's talk 'bout this young nigga that came up from nothing
Now he worth a motherfuckin' million (M)
Used to pay for a section, now they gotta bring us the backend to come in the building (Hah)
I knew that I was special back when we was breaking in houses and robbin' and stealin' (Okay)
We made you put your hands in the air, put that thang in your face, run your pockets, we dippin' (Hah)
And I ain't gotta act like I'm 'bout it, ain't ask for no vouchers, I'm really official (Okay)
Tryna look out for karma, I had good intentions, I'm still asking God to forgive me (Turn up)
I know I got these fuck niggas pissed off, I'm over they bitch house, I'm all on the WiFi
I'ma trick 'em and play Mr. Nice Guy (Hah)
When he front, I run off, nigga, bye-bye
I tell her I'm a motherfuckin' star
She can see me on TV, just turn it on Syfy
You know that I got a whole lot of hoes, and they all different colors, I mix 'em like tie-dye (Yeah)
We gon' make your ho dance with the devil, it's October 7th, shout out my boy DaDa (Ha)
Turn it up on a whole 'nother level, now they can't deny it, I'm catching they eye now (They eye)
You might not wanna run up on me to promote your CD 'less you ready to die now (Boom)
I can lower the price on the P's and you get 'em from me if you buy more than five now, bitch
And I'm the best motherfuckin' rapper, man, you know like
Th-that's just too much for 'em, like
You know it's just too much for 'em, First
You see what I'm saying, it's just too much for 'em, man
You know, it's too much for 'em
Blank Blank, you know
The best motherfuckin' rapper
The prettiest chocolate nigga alive
