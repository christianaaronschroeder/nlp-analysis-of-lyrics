Lyrics from Snippets

I know you won't stay in my life
Come get the rest of me

Arah, nah nah, nah nah, nah nah
Come kick it in my room
Nah nah, nah nah
And you can rock it all you want-
 Nah, nah, nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Uh, Iggs!
What you want
Give you, give you what you want
You will never get to cuff me
I'm too good to break
