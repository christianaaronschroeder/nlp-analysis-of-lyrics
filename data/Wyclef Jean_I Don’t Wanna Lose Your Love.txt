Ever since you came back around the way
I ain't tryin to be a player
So many things that I want to say
You know I got a little wiser
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I ain't got many friends i can talk to
No-one's around when I'm in trouble
You know I would do anything for you
We don't have to keep it under cover

I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
L-O-V-E Y-O-U
I ain't tryin to lose your love tonight
I just wanna make you feel alright
L-O-V-E Y-O-U
I'm just hoping you could spend the night
Kiss you, love you, hold you tight

Ever since you came back around the way
I ain't tryin to be a player
So many things that I want to say
You know I got a little wiser
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Ain't no need girl please close the door
And don't forget what I told you
I wanna do you right cause I did you wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon

I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
L-O-V-E Y-O-U
I ain't tryin to lose your love tonight
I just wanna make you feel alright
L-O-V-E Y-O-U
I'm just hoping you could spend the night
Kiss you, love you, hold you tight

The way my heart beats for you
Mention of your name
One touch never enough
You drivin' me insane
Swing me take you back
Who am i to blame but myself
Need you in my life it's simple and plain
Crazy nights arguments
Running towards the door
Lying to myself, not wanting you no more
No matter what we been through
You're the man that i adore
You're the only one i need in this world, see
People used to tell me i was crazy
Told me not to give in
Told me that you would never love me
All i did is pretend
I told them mind their business
Cause they not in my position
When i said that i was in love
They said i was trippin
I cut the haters off and i got into my man
Cause i take him for all he is
And he takes me as i am
The way i feel about him
It was God's perfect plan
The only one i need and i'm his girl
So let me hear you say

Ever since you came back around the way
I ain't tryin to be a player
So many things that I want to say
You know I got a little wiser
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
L-O-V-E Y-O-U
I ain't tryin to lose your love tonight
I just wanna make you feel alright
L-O-V-E Y-O-U
I'm just hoping you could spend the night
Kiss you, love you, hold you tight
