I came from the bottom, lil' nigga
All I ever dreamt about was being hood rich
No flexin', I don’t model, lil' nigga
I just count a check and I ain’t gotta show shit
Ayy, this Louis duffel gettin' heavy
'Cause it’s holding all my fetty
Got me feeling like ya-ya-ya
I know this shawty she gon' let me in
In the Benz or the Chevy and you fucking with a ya-ya-ya

I just wanna pull up in that Wraith (Skrrt skrrt)
Flooded diamonds, looking like a spaceship (Oh)
See I just wanna count that dough and take trips (Trip)
Pussy nigga, he be walking with a fake deep
My shooter got a .30 with the beam on it
She fucking so I had to put the team on it (Put the team on)
And we just tryna poke, we ain’t tryna marry
Plus she know I add the K, she get a hundred carat
I told my big homie we gon' see Ms, we ain't gotta be broke no more, ayy, yuh
And when they free Chillo, I know he a real nigga
Kiss all of my hoes on tour, yuh
Baby, I’m not nothin' like your last boy (No, no, no)
Shrimp, lobster, make sure you got your passport
In the coupe, I do not have a back store (Skrrt-skrrt)
I gettin' rich, ain't nothin I gotta ask for (BearOnTheBeat)

Rich sex, she always wanna have rich sex
I bend her over, I beat it, I leave her legs wet
Shooter with me, they always carry they big ting
Got a problem 'cause my niggas ain’t miss shit
See the whole game now I be screaming
We just tryna get the green, but we not vegan
I been running to the bag, so my feet hurt
Or it might be on Balenci' to the t-shirt (BearOnTheBeat)
If she never make a profit, make her teeth hurt
I’m not pimpin', I just like to get my feed first
I been sma-sma-smashing on past these bitches
If she bad, I might put that bitch in reverse
I'm the shit, these bitches used dumpin' on me
Twenty-piece on me, I feed these bitches they fucking hungry
High horse, ride my dick like a fucking pony
Speaker Knockerz, I got this shit on my fucking lonely
I came from the bottom, lil' nigga
All I ever dreamt about was being hood rich
No flexin', I don’t model, lil' nigga
I just got a check and I ain’t gotta show shit
Ayy, this Louis duffel gettin' heavy
'Cause it’s holding all my fetty
Got me feeling like ya-ya-ya
