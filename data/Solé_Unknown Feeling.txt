Hey, Bad Gyal

Is an unknown feeling when we touch
Never felt like this before
Let me dance it just for you
Boy you're gonna fall in love
Is an unknown feeling when we touch
Never felt like this before
Let me dance it just for you
Boy you're gonna fall in love

Porque te quiero ver
Bebé, come close to me
Is an unknown feeling when
You step me out of me
Porque te quiero ver
Bebé, come close to me
Is an unkown feeling when
You step me out of me
Is an unknown, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
(Is an unknown, is an unknown)
Is an unknown, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling
Is an unknown feeling, yeh
This is an unknown feeling
When we are dance we're doing this feeling, yeh
We're doing this feeling
 booty no time no mean it, no (no time no mean it, yeh)
We say: no time no mean it
Me and you together girl, that is the feeling
This is an unknow feeling, let's go
(Hey, Bad Gyal!)

When you dance you drive me crazy
I can see you're falling in love
Sabes que me gustas baby, lo que quiero es hacerte el amor
My pussy got the tightness for sure
And then I know how to tie you up
You want me to come to your bed
And then we ended;
On the floor riding you crazy
I can see you're falling in love
I don't wanna be your wifey
I just want to give a fuck to you
I just want to give a fuck to you
I just want to give a fuck to you
Is an unknown feeling, feeling
(Bad Gyal, Bad Gyal)
Feeling, feeling, is an unknown
(To you, bebé, to you, papi)
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling

Is an unknown feeling when we touch
Never felt like this before
Let me dance it just for you
Boy you're gonna fall in love
Is an unknown feeling when we touch
Never felt like this before
Let me dance it just for you
Boy you're gonna fall in love
