Yeehaw
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio, woo)

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match (Woo)
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Maserati rowdy, got a V12 for my bride (Skrrt)
Foggy rocky road, got a three-wheeler inside (Ayy)
All I wanna do is take a pill, catch a chill vibe
Real prince, I'm really the real don
I'ma take a horse to the South Berry Road (Ayy)
I don't remember her name, but I painted on her nose (Ayy)
Country money, I don't gotta do no chores
I'm a menace, I got women tryna sneak me through their doors (Skrrt)

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me, you can't tell me

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car

Hold up, let me tell y'all somethin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Hop up in my RZR, got a thousand acres
Ride up on the cows with it, pray that it don't faze her
Aye-o, aye-o, yippee-o ki-yay
If you ain't got no giddy up then giddy out my way

I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Yeehaw
