(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)

In my ways, I'm in my ways
I remember days, I was in my ways
I had to go get paid, go get it anyway
Did it anyway, fuck who feel a way
All this music cash, I'ma still get fuckin' paid
I'm not no Minute Maid, swear I'm not no Minute Maid
We in the 305 like we in the second grade
I be in my ways, when I walk through, they parade

I made 20 mil, I can't make up what I made
And I got some days that'll keep my in my ways
'Cause I am a sun, I gotta stay away from the shade
I got niggas that I raised with them infra rays
I got still niggas in the streets that still get me paid
I ain't worried 'bout you if you feel a way
I be takin' flights, leavin' out the bay
Then I go see my broads in the A
I'm from the town where that shit be goin' down
We got stranger things, we got demons, we got clowns
We got forty pounds that'll make you lose some pounds
We got Bobby Brown, I know you know Bobby Brown
We even got Wendy, if you take that, make no sound
We know where you at, no, you cannot make it out
Yeah, I'm from the north, but I got niggas that's down south
I'm back in my ways so you better watch your mouth
In my ways, I'm in my ways
I remember days, I was in my ways
I had to go get paid, go get it anyway
Did it anyway, fuck who feel a way
All this music cash, I'ma still get fuckin' paid
I'm not no Minute Maid, swear I'm not no Minute Maid
We in the 305 like we in the second grade
I be in my ways, when I walk through, they parade
