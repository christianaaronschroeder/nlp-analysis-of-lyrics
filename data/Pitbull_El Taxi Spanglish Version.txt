This the Spanglish remix, 
DJ  on the track, right
Mr.  Let's ride
Dale mami, para mi taxi

I met her in the backseat of a taxi
On my way to the club

Me lo paro  (El taxi )

Lo paro con una mano, lo paro que yo la vi
Yo, yo, yo, fer para el taxi
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo fer para el taxi
Ella está pa' un accidente, no me importa si está crazy
No me importa si hace vino por ahí
Yo, yo, yo, fer para el taxi
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo fer para el taxi

I met her in the backstreet
She jumped in the backseat of a taxi
She from New York City I'm from the south
But no diggity, no doubt
I'm not  turn around
She was sexy, flashy, classy, nasty
Everything I love in a woman if you ask me
She sneaky, freaky, and likes a little dirty
And boy was she a little flirty
Her name was Laura, de 
The only thing I 
Y ella saca 
Que hace? Vino, sí, hace vino
Ella hace de todo, to, to, to, to, to
(Yeah, she does it all, all, all)



She like to bump, like to grind, like to wind all the time
Yes she'll blow your mind and rob your heart blind
Yeah fine, I'm talking Caribbean queen
She's fine like something you never seen
She's fine like something straight out of a magazine
She's fine like Sofia Vergara
The only difference is her name is
Laura, de 
The only thing I 
Y ella saca 
Que hace? Vino, si, hace vino




Everything is just fine, because she like to wind
