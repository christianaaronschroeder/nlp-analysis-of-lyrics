(Cook that shit up, Quay)
Go'n light that up, man
Every time I turn around, I had a play outside the door
Call 'fore you knock, nigga, call before you knock, the fuck you talkin' 'bout, nigga?
The neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Go

Baby, he don't wanna be a player no more
I was lookin' out the peephole with it
Every time I turned around, I had a play outside the door
Now a nigga goin' beast mode with it
I got fifteen beds, we ain't layin' on the floor (Fifteen, fifteen beds)
I done hit a lotta freak hoes
Nigga, guess safe, safe for you to say that I'm a ho
I'm out the game, I'm not a player anymore

I got money to bail out
Won't pull over, they know we gon' bail out
Drop the window, turn right, throw the scale out
Fuck you mean we don't ride with no scale now?
We sell them bitches whole (We sell them bitches whole)
I had 'em knockin' at my door, I used to have 'em for the low
My neighbors think I'm sellin' dope (Neighbors think I'm sellin' dope)
I had the AC on, every winter, young nigga had the burner in his coat
I hit a nigga with the fan
I hop out, Glock out, I was takin' pictures with the fans
I can show you how to ride without a tool
All them times I hit the middleman
All them times I took a nigga off
Nigga wanna be a boss
But ain't have what it took to be the boss
She didn't know what it took to be my bitch
I ain't know what it took until I lost (Huh)
Baby, he don't wanna be a player no more
I was lookin' out the peephole with it
Every time I turned around, I had a play outside the door
Now a nigga goin' beast mode with it
I got fifteen beds, we ain't layin' on the floor (Fifteen, fifteen beds)
I done hit a lotta freak hoes
Nigga, guess safe, safe for you to say that I'm a ho
I'm out the game, I'm not a player anymore

I always be a pimp, I'm not a player, I get it
I'm wipin' all those bitches off my radar, no kizzy
Kirk, I'm always on the charts like I'm Drizzy
Dirk, fadeaway, I get you shot like Nowitzki
Can't wait to do the show when I'm in Dallas
We be eatin' healthy on the low, she made a salad
I been gettin' money on the low, it’s hard to hide it
My baby like to fuck me on the floor, I let her ride it
It's off the top, I ever make a song, I never write it
I'm a GRAMMY-nominated hitmaker
Lame-nigga-bitch taker, fuck the police
You yellin' with a gun, now how the fuck we gon' think?
You take my daughter daddy, how the fuck she gon' eat?
I kill me a cop, what the fuck they gon' think?
Probably hang on the tree
I'm dangerous, I keep a banger on me
Gotta drop down and pray 'fore I sleep (Lord)
Baby, he don't wanna be a player no more
I was lookin' out the peephole with it
Every time I turned around, I had a play outside the door
Now a nigga goin' beast mode with it
I got fifteen beds, we ain't layin' on the floor (Fifteen, fifteen beds)
I done hit a lotta freak hoes
Nigga, guess safe, safe for you to say that I'm a ho
I'm out the game, I'm not a player anymore
Baby, he don't wanna be a player no more (Yeah)
I was lookin' out the peephole with it
Every time I turned around, I had a play outside the door
Now a nigga goin' beast mode with it
I got fifteen beds, we ain't layin' on the floor (Fifteen, fifteen beds)
I done hit a lotta freak hoes
Nigga, guess safe, safe for you to say that I'm a ho
I'm out the game, I'm not a player anymore
