See back in 2003 when they wasn't hip to me
I was sellin' them breakdowns, tell the truth I was tryna live through it
They keep a liquor store on every damn corner

They tryna search us every day, we ain't got nothin' on us
I drink that lean every day like it's a Corona

I'd be focused on the prize (Focused), Trey ball every time (Yo)
Flex like exercise (Hey), shot clock, never mind that
'Cause we pull it at the perfect time (We pull it)
Ball like Porziņģis, and your foot was on the line (You blew it)
