These judges ain't givin’ a fuck about us, they just washin' us up
I'm in the penthouse with the dirty money, tryna’ wash it up
Back at granny house we were servin' junkies, tryna run it up
It was a lot of niggas that was eating 'round us
They was watching' us starve
We servin' lean and bars, tryna bust down a new Audemar
I'm seein' blue and red lights everytime I'm whippin’ all the cars
You get 20 years fed time, for the 6 months you ballin’ hard
Everytime I stop at red lights I be clutching the carbon hard
I was knocking down doors and doors
And my niggas surfin' from car to car
Tryna go get that new car tomorrow
Tripped in this life, how I fall so hard
I’m tryna to hop in the Wraith, lookin' from star to star
The streets, I been scarred so hard
Goin' to war for war, tryna be larger than large yeah yeah
