Thinkin' 'bout my grandmama and shit (Wait a minute, who are you?)
I got the number one record, they acknowledged the jit (Ayy, yo, Kid)
They goin' crazy when they play it, head bobbin' and shit
And I'm just somewhere fucked up thinkin' 'bout my father and shit
They found him dead a couple days before I started tour
Same day I flew back to the city from Miami
I was out there with the family
Just lookin' at my daughter
Thinkin' to myself like, "Damn, my baby look just like my daddy"
Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that's fucked up
That shit there was confusin', a lil' bit, you know I flew in with the stick
Okay, like let me know what's up before I lose it in this bitch
And everybody tryna talk, I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna click
I'm tryna send somebody wit' him
Somebody let me know what's happenin'
My last name K-I-R-K, Kirk
You know how I rock behind my daddy
You know I never gave a fuck about the world, just about my family
How the fuck I make it to the top same day I lost the nigga that had me?
How a nigga perform on BET and a year ago couldn't afford a sandwich?
I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali
What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'
I got some questions, I'm a die about respect if I don't get answers
My mama stood up in that chair, took it like a G when she had cancer
My brother be thinkin' that we don't love him and let him struggle like we ain't family
Like I won't give up all I got to see you happy, nigga
We shocked the world, everybody know what's happenin', nigga
I'm still Lil' Jon Jon, my song, it just went platinum, nigga
We on our own time, let's go move out to Cali, nigga
Put the kids in homeschool, let's go get us a mansion, nigga
Let's raise our kids right, let's watch the shit we teach 'em, nigga
Let's start a business for you so they can't say that you leechin', nigga
How I know I'm the chosen one, 'cause sometimes when I be speakin', nigga
Like on this song, I ain't rappin', I'm preachin', nigga
If I love you, then I need ya (Let's go)
I fuck with you like Martin fuck with Gina (Uh)
We family like we Venus and Serena (Hey)
Let's go get married like we Thankgod and Kenisha (Okay)
Don't give a fuck about the world, just 'bout my people (Facts)
I don't care what the fuck they told you, we ain't equal (Uh-uh)
Niggas ain't cut from the same cloth, these niggas see-through (Ayy)
And I be too busy doin' me to see what he do, nigga

Yeah, verse two, that lil' nigga from the other side (Uh-huh)
And I do it myself, whenever I ride, you know that my brothers ride (Okay)
And I still got a lotta shit on my mind that I can't undecide (Yeah, yeah)
Got me ready to slide, feelin' like Doughboy when his brother died (Boyz n the Hood)
You know how I step, you know how I rep, you know about Baby, nigga (You know about Baby)
You know how I'm comin' back for that cross if you ever play me, nigga (Get back)
You know how I got it up out the mud and turned it to gravy, nigga (Huh)
And hit the rap game like crack cocaine in the '80s, nigga

Fuck you niggas talkin' 'bout, bruh? Like.. (Oh my God, oh)
Look (Oh my God)
Look, man
Look (Oh my God)
Baby on Baby, now that's Baby on Baby
God is great
Big dawg, Baby

Rest in peace to my grandma

We family like we Venus and Serena (Hey)
Let's go get married like we Thankgod and Kenisha (Okay)
