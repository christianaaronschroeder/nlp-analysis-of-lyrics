Othello on the beat
You fire, ooh, ooh
You ain't never met another nigga like me
You say you lookin' for a man, you got the right one
She feelin' me, she say, "You so wavy, boy, you sexy, yeah, you fire"
Look

I'm like, "What's crackin'?" She like, "Pop, I got a man"
I'm like, "Damn, how you know me?" Say she got me on the 'Gram
I say, "Look, I understand, but baby, I'm the fan
'Cause you the baddest bitch I ever seen walk on the land"
She say, "What's that on your face?" And I say, "It's a cold world"
Way you bitin' your lips though got me like "Oh, girl"
Get money and stay aggressive, baby, it's your world
Martin talkin' to Gina, baby, you go, girl
Who you with? I'm with the lions and gorillas, gangbangers and drug dealers
All them scammers and them killers who I hang with
Yeah, I taste good, ain't no onions on my sandwich
I'm 823 and everybody know I'm sanctioned
Why? 'Cause if I shoot, I'ma shoot that, woo and I'ma woo back
Yeah, I'm from the floss, you know the language
I put it on the table so that everything is clear
Put them diamonds on your necklace to match them on your ear
She like, "Send me a text"
The end of the night, she was laid up in the bed
Liftin' up her dress, had her bent over the ledge
Kissin' on her neck when she went to give me head
What's next? Look
Let me fuck you, let me suck you, let me eat you, let me hold you
Let me beat up on that pussy like a real nigga's supposed to
If you ain't know I had the power, let me show you
Shark on your plate, we eatin' dinner at Nobu
You ain't never met another nigga like me
You say you lookin' for a man, you got the right one
She said, "Boy, you handsome, boy, you sexy, boy, you fire"
You ain't never met another nigga like me
Keep it real, girl, I'm lookin' for a wifey
She feelin' me, she say, "Boy, you wavy, you so sexy, boy, you fire"

I'ma call you every day at twelve o' clock, "How you doin'?" like Wendy
About your day and that new bag that I bought you from Fendi
I'ma treat you right as long as you let me
Louboutin and Giuseppes, all I do is chase fetti
Know I ride with that semi, so let me know when you ready
I'ma pull up in a Benz, just finished collectin' funds
Grabbin' on your ass, got a Rollie on my wrist
Baby, you could bring a friend, that's when the party begin
All them tigers on my collar ain't always just been Gucci
Ridin' past your block bumpin' YFN Lucci
You sayin' talkin' is cheap, so you know I had to prove it
So I made this song so you can add it to your music
I'm top tier, yeah, I ain't never kept it Nancy
But like Jamie Foxx, I'ma always keep you fancy
Gucci trench, feel like fishin' gear
Put me on any block, you know I'ma get it there
You ain't never met another nigga like me
You say you lookin' for a man, you got the right one
She said, "Boy, you handsome, boy, you sexy, boy, you fire"
You ain't never met another nigga like me
Keep it real, girl, I'm lookin' for a wifey
She feelin' me, she say, "Boy, you wavy, you so sexy, boy, you fire"

You fire, yeah, yeah
You fire, yeah, woo
