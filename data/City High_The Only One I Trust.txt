It's a ghetto fairytale
(yeah yeah yeah)
It was two weeks before my son's birthday
The D.T's ringing my bell (Ma'am we need to ask a few questions)
They told me the raid would go down anyday
And if I was smart I wouldn't tell (no no)
It was all over him your
My boyfriend the criminal
He was caught up in the game
And the FBI warned if I didn't go along
They'd make sure I never saw my son or my boyfriend again
(Remember this, you are a convicted felon on probation)
But how could I just turn him in?
(Ma'am if you don't help us, you'll never see your son again. Trust me)
He would always tell me
I know your afraid
But you can't leave me now
Lean on my shoulder
Soon it'll be over
I'm trying to build our future
I'm doing this for us
Your the only one I love
The only one I trust
I'd been with him for about 4 years and I swear
He gave me anything I could dream (anything)
But the life that he lived was a nightmare I swear
Wasn't clean he was blinded by the cream
All the murderous capers, the trips to Las Vegas
Making millions from paper blood-stained (blood-stain money)
Stuck in my head like a song, I saw every sin I knew every wrong
And if I don't go along, I'd never see my family again
No no no
Hmmm
(So whats it gonna be?)
(hey hey hey)
(I know my rights)
(One phone call from me and your son's going to a foster home.)
(Whatever)
(Answer the question)
(I don't have to answer shit)
He would always tell me (tell me yeah)
I know your afraid
But you can't leave me now
Lean on my shoulder
Soon it'll be over (soon it'll be over)
I'm trying to build our future
I'm doing this for us
Your the only one I love
The only one I trust
It was Saturday evening, we were home watching TV
He looked in my eyes I wanted to cry (oh)
My son ran to hug him, he kissed him goodnight
How could I do this, blooding do this? When I knew he would die
FED's rushed the door, yelled 'everyone on the floor'
My man pulled his 9 and started to fire
He was a soldier of cause in a war he couldn't win
But without him I'm lost
So I stood by his side and went down with him
Oh
No no no no
No no no nooo
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Oooooh
He would always tell me
I know your afraid
But you can't leave me now
Lean on my shoulder
Soon it'll be over
I'm trying to build our future
I'm doing this for us
Your the only one I love
The only one I trust
I know your afraid
But you can't leave me now
Lean on my shoulder
Soon it'll be over
I'm trying to build our future
I'm doing this for us
Your the only one I love
The only one I trust
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry...
