That's the type of shit I'm on
Let me see you get them on
Back it up a bit, yeah that's it, cause I can see your thong
Caramel skin tone
Damn, you look like Nia Long
Don't be acting like that lil' mama, cause I can leave you 'lone
Mix the lime with that Patron
That's what we drinking on
She wanna go out to eat, but me, JD, I'm thinkin' home
Just so I can see 'em off

Wearin' dem jean like that will make me take trips with you to Rome

Hope you ain't up in here with your man ma
I love it when you wiggle it, shake it
Drop it, and do your little dance
True Religion, 7's or dem rocking Republics
Or the ones that fit the best and show it just how we love it
Know just how to hug it
Know just how to cuff it
When you walk away it make me wanna rub and say
Hey now (hey, hey), hey now (hey)
You know they thick from the ATL to the H-Town

***data\songs_individual\Chingy_Hate it or Love it.txt***

Uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hate it or love it. 
[Spoken: I dedicate this to all my enemies
All the motherfuckers who don't like me
Don't like what I'm doing 
Don't like that I'm getting this money
Don't like that I'm back with the DTP family. Luda, what up?
Y'all can suck a dick, though
This your boy, Ching-a-ling
St. Louis to Atlanta, Atlanta to New York, New York to Cali. Worldwide!
You heard! Let's go.]

I know you cowards heard of me
You probably want to murder me
Ya hustlers to the third degree
I cut you like it's surgery
We hold court in the street and you committed perjury
Don't be nervous, B, the ambulance can't make this emergency
Urgently and purposely
I'm hurting the competitor who irking me is gon' be
Closed curtains, see
Blaze up the purple weed
The herbal trees give me the need to work a beat
Flow so for a hit that I deserve to be
Just work with me
Holy riders in my circle be
Not no rubber football but my turf with me
Think of jerking me
Out my dollar bills?
Beat that cat four months ago
And you can hear him holler still
Am I a G?
Certainly. So ain't no murking me
Phony cats be perping, B
While y'all dames be slurping me
Lurking, we creep at night
Pop on slight and hurt the beast
Nobody know where you at --
Tell mama to search the streets
Hate it or love it. 
[Spoken: I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck if you bitches don't like me
Eat a dick, nigga. I wasn't put on this Earth for you to like me, man
I was put on this Earth to get money. And live my life
Ha ha! Uh huh
Don't ask me how my career doing. My career doing just fine
I'm good, man, I'm good. Just fine without you hypocrites and you critics
With all that gossip and bullshit. Let's go!]

Direspect the clique, neglect the clique, the tec'll spit, we wreck this shit
We rep the strip, y'all dudes broads - shoulda had breasts and shit
Confess to this, I'm the next to hit
Back for the first time, still rep what's on my necklace bitch
Bitch! No, I can't cry about the past
Left Capitol and signed with Def Jam on they ass
Let's get mo' money, real fast, I'm in first, you still last
You the worst, I feel bad for you fags
I feel sad that I had to buy the new Range
Cause the Jag got crashed, my bad
I know that's arrogant
But I don't care, and shit --
Shit, I got rich from saying "Right Thurr" and shit
Hate it or love it. 
[Spoken: Crazy, ain't it? That's wild, that's wild
It ain't even like I made the word up, nigga, that's how I talk
That's how we talk in the Lou. That shit made me a millionaire
Getting money! That sound kinda cocky? So what? Fuck it! Get money!
Let's get it! But you know these motherfuckers everyday they always coming up to me asking me
Aw shit, there they go asking me questions again.]

Is me and Luda cool? Did you and Luda feud?
Today's news, I ain't in the motherfucking mood
I get  with dudes
 living your 
That's old, this new, this any of us, you getting burned
In which ya' raps I ain't concerned
Got a check for some mill, I signed off, so it's confirmed
Eh, look, homie, wait your turn
I ain't broke, nigga, look here, I'm straight as a perm

Hate it or love it. 
[Spoken: As a perm, nigga, I'm good! That's straight as hell
Y'all just need to start making sure y'all good
Stick your nose outta other motherfuckers' business, man
I'm doing a'ight, my family's doing a'ight
My homies doing a'ight
Shout out to my niggas locked up!
Even my broads doing a'ight --
On they own! Cause I ain't giving them a dime!
Not a dime! That sum it up for you niggas?
Hate me or love me, baby, I'm out. Ching-a-ling
Jackpot. 
Deserve!]

Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)

I like the way you look in them pants, see ya fine (Fine)
Your momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (Dime)
The type of girl that'll get'cha up and go make you grind (Grind)
I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, Dirty, makin' her mine
Look at her hips (What?), look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (Stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (Back)
I like it when I touch it 'cause she moan a lil' bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a lil' bit
I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the Regal
I swooped on her like an eagle swoop down on its prey
I know you popular, but you gonna be famous today, I say
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)

She be shoppin' in Frontenac
Just look at her front and back
Man, she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl, can I taste yo cat?
Gave her three hundred to strip, like buyin' a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events (Yeah), cuss out the press when she pass (Yeah)
All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin', she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gon' drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops

I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)

Plus I like it when she bring it back (Say it)
Ooh, (Uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (Uh-huh) do what you do (Woo)

Gimme what you got for a pork chop
Uh, he threw it at me like I was a shortstop
Huh, workin' in a Fatty Girl Hugga Top
Then she back it up on me and let it drop (Drop)
Make it hop, boing, like a bunny (Bunny)
Girl, can I touch you where it's sunny?
Or a purse and make you give her some money
She should pose for Sports Illustrated
It's like a picture-perfect site
When she pass, all the other girls hate it

But I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr (Make me sturr)
