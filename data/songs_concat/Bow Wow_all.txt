Picture me and Pamela Lee in a drop
I show her how a real kid rocks
Me and Kelis on the beach having fun
Her cell rung 9-1-1, it's God's son
I don't wait I just wait to they really ready
I told usher I got it bad for Chilli
Told Jermaine me and Janet had a thing
He couldn't understand so I had to explain
I said look our size is the same
But I'm way cuter it was easier to scoop her
Now she's gone
Chante moore's on the phone
Now Kenny Lattimore cries all alone
Brad Pitt started a fight club again
Cause me and Jennifer Aniston real close friends
J.lo I don't know
I don't wanna go where everybody been
Affleck who's next
Forget your chain I snatch your chick from your neck
Eric Benet, Banet be not
You the x-man I'm all that Halle's got
Type of man that Tamia deserves
So you can keep grant on the injured reserve
I got dreams of bagging a hollywood chick
I'm just saying, no I'm ain't playing
Dreams of bagging a hollywood chick
As I sit back, relax get my hair corn-rolled
Thinking 'bout the little honey's that I wanna know
Raven Symone kinda grown holla back
I wanna go one on one with Kyla Pratt
Picture that, what would her moms say
Kiss Solange and turn her into Beyonc√©
Cause I'm a mack no trivia to that
Nivea cleaning my throwbacks in laundrymats
And I'm a g her, yeah, every time I see her
Squeeze 3LW up into my 2 seater (eh)
Christina Milian is the bomb as she move her body like a snake ma (oh)
Jennifer Freeman got kicked from the crib
She was talking 'bout some wife and
Kids
Meagan Good if I could then I would
You say I won't but I really think I
Should
Show my rims to the Olsen Twins
Yo they looked at each other and they both got thin
Cause I'm a pimp
I feed 'em lobster and shrimp
Well you know it's just a rhyme I don't mean no offence

And I ain't no magician but let me Copperfield
Baby, my love is real, tell me where you want it at
And she know my game sharper than a pack of thumbtacks
Baby let me tell you where you can put your clothes at
Throw them on the floor and leave yo' heels by the doormat
Yeah, you leaving here with a sore back
Love my dick so much she had to go and get my name tat

Neighbors complaining saying we causin' a raucous
To show you just what kind of mood I'm in

And you know my love is unconditional
And for these hoes on the road girl I'll never diss you (Never, yeah!)

***data\songs_individual\Bow Wow_Ghetto Girls.txt***

Uh, like when Janet was Justice, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
A shorty that can tell you when the J's come out
Get creative with they haircuts like T-boz
Fav'rite rappers is Bow Wow, Snoop, JD, & Nas
Always up in they somebody's face tryin' to fuss
And to get where she goin', she can take the bus
Like when Jada was Peaches in the movie Shame
Or the type you can find sitting at a Ruckers game
Only like dealing with cats that love to floss
Only like rocking the stuff that really costs
Lip gloss shinnis' tattoos on her back
Attitude like Mary J., mixed with Brat
You can find a man at a beauty shop, mall, or church
Name brand head to toe with the matching purse
So all that siddity stuff, y'all can keep
'Cause only girls that keep it ghetto get to ride with me (fo' sho)

Ghetto girls that like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball with the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-Aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like, so tell me, baby, is that you?
When they ride with they man like you won't believe
Switch the color on there hair like Eve
When they talk like I talk but walk like a lady
Snap like I snap and get a little crazy
I love that especially when they bout the cheese
Type that won't front for some Mickey D's
Bandanas to barrets daisy dukes to spandex all thats good with me
I like em' G-H-E-T-T-O, now believe me she gots to go
At the corner store buying up all the sweets
From Choo Choo's to Rice Krispy Treats on my street
That's all I see like everyday
And they do what they do in a crazy way
Hang with the ballers so they never pay
And they usually got a name that's hard to say (ya heard)

Ghetto girls that like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball with the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-Aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like, so tell me, baby, is that you?

Let's talk about it now
If ya know what I mean
Shawty let yourself be seen (ya heard)
Let's talk about it now
If ya know what I mean
Shawty let yourself be seen
Uh, uh
Ghetto girls that like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball with the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixing up the bomb Kool-Aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like, so tell me, baby, is that you?

I ain't never had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

Now I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen 'em all but ain't none of them at all
(Like you)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby, still I ain't impressed 'cause ain't none of them at all
(Like you)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just
(Like you)
And baby that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
'Cause when we first got together
Started hanging out ,you was
Skeptical at first, had to figure out if
I was the kind of guy to try to dog you out but
I ain't that kind of guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned into my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't tripping or acting shady
'Cause baby, you know
I ain't never had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you

And every time I think about you I (cry)
When you ride when you call when you come I (ride)
Your love is amazing to me
Can't wait 'til I see you
(I wanna be with you again)
And every time you're out on the road
(I'll make a trip)
And whenever I'm doing a show
(Don't you forget)
That I'm your
(Main chick)
Who got that
(Game chick)
One and the
(Same chick)
The one you can hang with
I ain't never had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you

Okay, we, hit the mall, pop tags, spend a few G's and
Hit the runway to a new season
(Season)
It ain't nothing, you're spoiled and what I care for
Feel like I ain't doing enough that's when I share more
(Share more)
I give you this, give you that, what you need, love
(Love)
You know I got it, holla at me if you need love
(Love)
And affection, 'cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job but I'll do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go
I get with you when I can so that's how I let you know
And you be trippin' 'cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I holler to right after my shows
And I was trippin' in a sense I was tense
From my body loose around you, what I'ma do without you
I gotta get it together say whatever
Since I met you my life seems so better
I ain't never had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you
I ain't never had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you

Girl I can‚Äôt lie, it‚Äôs bomb as fuck
And like a U-Haul truck I watch her back it up
She do that thing with her tongue, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs up
Then roll a blunt right after we fuck
Pop a molly, It‚Äôs ‚Äôbout to get crazy
Girl stand back and catch these babies
I‚Äôm gettin‚Äô impatient, girl I‚Äôm feelin‚Äô anxious
She said she don‚Äôt fuck on a first night basis

I got pussy on my mind (That‚Äôs all I do)
I think about your pussy all the time (That‚Äôs e‚Äôryday)
I thought I saw a puddy cat, pussy on my mind
I did, I did, I did swear I got that pussy on my mind
And I can‚Äôt stop thinkin‚Äô ‚Äôbout it you know I got that pussy on my mind

Yeah, that‚Äôs all I think about
You ain‚Äôt even gotta ask, girl I‚Äôll eat you out
Like I ain‚Äôt had a meal, you know I‚Äôm fiending for it
Talking freaky like you grew up in a circus girl
You must be on a pill, or too much of Patron
Mixed with that mo‚Äô wet, tugging on my Fendi belt
Let‚Äôs hit the tel, just promise you won‚Äôt tell
It don‚Äôt stop running through my head I work it out
You know that
I got pussy on my mind (That‚Äôs all I do)
I think about your pussy all the time (That‚Äôs e‚Äôryday)
I thought I saw a puddy cat, pussy on my mind
(Front back side, you know how I hit it)
I did, I did, I did swear I got that pussy on my mind
(Front back side, you know how I hit it)
And I can‚Äôt stop thinkin‚Äô ‚Äôbout it you know I got that pussy on my mind

I think I‚Äôm dreamin‚Äô
Cause you look like that girl I met last weekend
Shawty bad, yeah she fine
Hit it from the back, know she feel it in her spine
Cause I be fiendin‚Äô for her, I be missin‚Äô it
Put it in my face, can I have a lick?
Can I have a lick? can I have a lick?
Can I, can I, can I, can I have a lick?

I got pussy on my mind (That‚Äôs all I do)
I think about your pussy all the time (That‚Äôs e‚Äôryday)
I thought I saw a puddy cat, pussy on my mind
I did, I did, I did swear I got that pussy on my mind
And I can‚Äôt stop thinkin‚Äô ‚Äôbout it you know I got that pussy on my mind
Always on my mind, always on my mind
Not a day go by, when it ain‚Äôt on my mind
Always on my mind, always on my mind
Not a day go by, when it ain‚Äôt on my mind

I got pussy on my mind (That‚Äôs all I do)
I think about your pussy all the time (That‚Äôs e‚Äôryday)
I thought I saw a puddy cat, pussy on my mind
I did, I did, I did swear I got that pussy on my mind
And I can‚Äôt stop thinkin‚Äô ‚Äôbout it you know I got that pussy on my mind

Caught Up

Man I'm caught up between the two
I don't know what to do
Should I be honest (or should I be)
And to tell'em both the truth (what should I do)
And I know they know each other I know (that is wrong)
But I can't fight my feelings no more
And she don't know that you be riding this horse, Polo
Begging me to hit it raw I be like "no no"
And when I'm with shawty I be texting at the same time
Have her best friend all night hittin' my main line
I wish I could fuck'em at the same time
Got em both strippin' for a nigga on the FaceTime
And if they, find out, about this
I know that they gon' be trippin'
Gotta play, it cool
Or both of these bitches might kill me

Way too real
Can't let'em find out, let'em find out
It's gon' get real
(it's about to go down)
And if I had it my way I'd have both of em, that real
(If I had it my way)
Just me and my two bad bitches on the side that real
(Me and my two bad bitches)
Shits about to get real (it's about to get real) (turnup)
(it's about to get real)
Now the whole time my nigga had a girlfriend
But I'm still fucking off with her best friend
Man I can't even stay away from her
That's cause a nigga really love her
Then she wanna be my main lady
But she can't be my main lady (why)
And I know this gon' sound shady (what)
But my other girl 'bout to have my baby (turnup)
And my other girl know about us
Damn, now I know I'm in some shit (goddamn)
She went through my phone last night (last night)
And saw all them naked pictures that you sent
And now she's crazy, crazy
Talkin' 'bout how she gon' kill me and that bitch
I'm like "come on baby, baby" (I love everything about you)
She think I'll go crazy 'cuse that's my thing
