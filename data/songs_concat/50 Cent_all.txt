New York City
You are now rappin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist the lah
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap â€˜cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad â€˜cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? â€˜Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us

Flippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money

Catch it coming, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's

It's the Infamous Mobb, M-O-B-B
We can't be touched nigga, can't you see (G-Unit)

You do you man cause me I'm 'gon do my thing, you know I do my thing
I'mma get my drink on and party like it's ok

Trust me man it's ok, bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house they're like, "Oh no"
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'mma tell you what Em told me, homey
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

You wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit these tricks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I donâ€™t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

You already know how it go, I bang, I shine
I play, I stay I'm going for mine
I'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes
I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems
I don't run, I just gun you all up
But we ain't come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook I clean I swear that mami
Just as long as you don't go off and tell nobody
I go down low, I'm lying I'm trying my best to let you know
Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

***data\songs_individual\50 Cent_Too Rich for the Bitch.txt***

That bitch there a door knob, nigga, we all get a turn
Fuck you catching feelings for? I mean when your ass'll learn?
That pussy community, community

While you be all in her DM, nigga
I be all in that BM with her
You be all in your feelings 'bout it
Like "when I see him I'mma kill this nigga"
I'm on three-way like, "you hear this nigga?"
I should take the bitch back and clip the nigga
Pussy make him not pay attention
You punk bitch go with this nigga
I throw bands, bitch, these hoes love me
I fuck a bad bitch 'till she ugly
Put the pussy in recovery
Iâ€™m like, "now what you think of me?"
Niggas goinâ€™ out just to talk to these hoes
Blowinâ€™ big bankrolls on clothes
Now they wonder where the money at
Yeah, the motherfucking money that they had from the re-up gone
I don't do no stalkin'
I don't cuff no hoes, tell a bitch keep walkin'
I don't do much talkin'
Right now I'm flossin', I do this often
Gotta flex on a bitch
Tag team, I got next on a bitch (I got next)
I ain't stressing a bitch
But every now and then I blow a check on a bitch
Drop that ho back off in her hood, too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Drop that ho back off at that club, I'm too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Now do it, baby, do it, baby (do it, do it)
Do it, baby, do it (yeah yeah)
Now do it, baby, do it, baby (do it, do it)
Do it, baby, do it (yeah yeah)

Shawty playin', she lame for that
She ain't have to put a nigga name in that
Beefin' over these bitches, not me
Nah, nigga, I ain't came for that
We don't talk to no pillows, nigga
We brought all these bitches with us
You act like you got all the hoes
But all I see is niggas with you
She don't like when you pullin' on her
She like me, I'm pullin' up
I act like I don't want her
You act like you can't get enough
That bitch there like dopeboys
If you got money she goin' for it
I drink that hoe, her head so good
She gon' have you there like, "oh lawd"
All this time you ain't on
I done bought her shit you can't afford
She take pictures with your money
But you tell her she can't do it
All you niggas don't panic
I'm just tryna understand it
I must take these hoes for granted
Or you niggas just so romantic
Drop that ho back off in her hood, too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Drop that ho back off at that club, I'm too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Now do it, baby, do it, baby (do it, do it)
