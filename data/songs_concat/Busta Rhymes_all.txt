Ron Browz, yes!
Oh, we back in the most amazin' way
Well, lemme introduce you to the new talk
Let's get straight to it
C'mon!

La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo
We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money
Hala sheiki, ha lini falla
Mili ha lan shi inni mala
We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money

Now, there ain't no way that you could kill the beast dead
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread
I got oil well money in the desert playing golf
Dolce shorts, dashiki with a Louis Scarf
Chest cold, diamonds make a nigga wanna cough
In Dubai, 20 million on the villa loft
And then I step up in the club and then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic!
La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo
We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money

Seven star hotels, Maybach, movie sick
Big bitches, knock-kneed camel-toed groupie shit
Women walk around while security on camelback
Club on fire now, niggas don't know how to act
Sittin' in casinos while I'm gamblin' with Arafat
Money long, watch me purchase pieces of the Almanac
Y'all already know, I got the streets buzzin'
While I make you bow down and make Salaat like a Muslim

La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo
We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money

See, now I take trips to Baghdad dummy
While I use stacked chips and count Arab money now
I don't need to get fresh, about to grow a beard duke
So much cake even the money look weird too
Domestic bread, and I'm broad, I'm tryna eat right
Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Al Saud
They respect the value of my worth in Mali, Malaysia
Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia!
La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo
We getting Arab money
We getting Arab money

***data\songs_individual\Busta Rhymes_Ill Vibe.txt***

My rhymes create life like the birds and the bees
Make Funkmaster Flex say 'Yo, I'm feeling these'
Flows make you shit in your drawers, change your dungarees
Smoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munchies
Bounce down the block, eat food at Luigi's
Ass constipated—too much extra cheese
But anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's
I met some Siamese twins from overseas.. Lebanese
Lesbians with the friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend, she was straight Black-Portuguese
Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, Aloe Vera leaves
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick you would KILL for to get between the knees
Yo. I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys Rob me for my G's
Had to show this crazy broad I mastered my degrees and my Ph.D's
Got your face on camera; motherfucker say cheese
You better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze
Getting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees

I caught that ill vibe Tip
Word, Bus? Yo yo word
That ill vibe Tip
Yo, word, Bus? Yo yo word
Cause when I'm in the place you know my shit be absurd
I caught that ill vibe Bus
Word, Tip? Yo yo word
That ill vibe Bus
Word, Tip? Yo yo word
So when I hold the mic you know my shit be absurd
I caught that ill vibe Bus
Word, Tip? Yo yo word
I got weight on my shoulders in the form of this beat
Ain’t nothin' sweet, on the street, for good deeds I compete
Come on complete, and unique, so get back in your stance
We enhance and we're playing the whole world circumstance
So do good in your hood even though you puff lye
Positive to comply, don’t screw face and act rah
Progress, don't fall back, we can't have that
I'll hold your hand, Black, we can't wind up with scratch
I put my best foot forward as I play this life
'Cause this world is bound to get ya like a double-edged knife
In the jam we regulate, 'cause we organize
Logic-a-lly thinking with Allah's enterprise
A lot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab
Peace to the West Coast and the East, we fab
Oh, need I make mention that the crew we've got
Make things get hot, like the .44 shot (Blaow!)
No, we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek
In the world that we live, kindness is viewed as weak
So, we got to stay on point for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the frauds and build grounds with our friends
(Why's that?) So we can live right until time ends
(Yo, why's that?) Amalgamate, so we can get these ends
(Yo, true that) Busta and Tip, you know we make minds bend
I caught that ill vibe Bus
Word, Tip? Yo yo word
That ill vibe Bus
Word, Tip? Yo yo word
Yo, when I hold the mic you know my shit be absurd
I caught that ill vibe Tip
Word, Bus? Yo yo word
That ill vibe Tip
Say word, Bus? Yo yo word
Cause when I'm in the place you know my shit be absurd
I caught that ill vibe Bus
Word, Tip? Yo yo word
That ill vibe Bus
Word, Tip? Yo yo word
Yo, when we energetic, you know the shit be absurd
I caught that wow shit Tip
Word, Bus? Yo yo word
That ill vibe Tip
Say word? Yo yo word
Cause when I'm in the place you know my shit be absurd
