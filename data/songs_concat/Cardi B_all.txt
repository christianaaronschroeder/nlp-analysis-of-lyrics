***data\songs_individual\Cardi B_Cheap Ass Weave.txt***

The nerve of you bitches
Like, oh my God, I got no words for you bitches
Like, who's really serving you bitches?
I need some answers, I'm worried for bitches
Like, this really absurd
No wonder these niggas stay curving you bitches
Don't even take no more selfies
That weave don't even deserve any pictures
Like, where did you buy that shit?
Who really acknowledged it?
What made you feel that you would be lit if you went and copped that shit?
They tell you ya look good?
Wasn't you iffy?
Oh, I know, they tell you that you get two bundles for fifty
Girl, you ain't low
I know how this go
Cheap shoes is okay, cheap dress is okay, but cheap weave is a "no"
Don'tcha do it to yourself that's bad for your health
Don't fuck up your flow
Talk shit about me with ya dusty ass weave?
Now you outta control
I'm Cardi B, I come through and I kill everything, everything and that's a fact
Got me on my hitman shit like brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap-brrap
I'm fully reloaded, full clip
I cut to the chase, snip-snip
That weave gotta go, pink slip
Looking washed up, drip-drip
I can't believe it
This is insane
How can you talk about me when your weave is inside of the grave?
(It's dead, bitch)
I can't believe it
Or is it just me?
But why all these bitches just walking the streets with some cheap ass weave

Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
How everything on fleek when you got some cheap ass weave?
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
Don't even step to me if you got some cheap ass weave

So check yourself before you come at me
Cardi B killing shit, I'm causing casualties
I am a masterpiece, you are a tragedy
Finish you like Mortal Kombat; fatality
I got shit jumping like What a Time...
Like Jumpman, Jumpman
That weave you got should be a crime
You got no luck, man
And how you niggas even let them in the crib with that?
You know that weave stink, that shit need a Tic Tac
Now you tell me you pulling hair off your pillows, hair off the sheets, and even hair out your asscrack
So cheap weave is okay? I think I missed that
I see a track showing, you need to fix that
You got a braid loose, you need to twist that
You got it fucked up, I would never pick that
Lady Leshurr done told y'all to go brush your teeth
But after you done, you leave the crib with that cheap ass weave?
I'm begging Lord, oh God, oh God, oh please, oh please
Please just bless these thots, these thots with they cheap ass weave
I can't believe it
This is insane
How can you talk about me when your weave is inside of the grave?
(It's dead, bitch)
I can't believe it
Or is it just me?
But why all these bitches just walking the streets with some cheap ass weave

Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
How everything on fleek when you got some cheap ass weave?
Cheap ass weave
Cheap ass weave
Don't even step to me if you got some cheap ass weave

Seein' all these hoes
You knew that I don't like her
What type of crazy shit you on?

You want me to come to your crib and get comfortable
What if I wanna move in and shit?
I will show up on some random shit
Don't let me catch a bitch, you wanna chance that shit?
You should just dead it
I swear to God you gon' regret it
Watch when I start askin' you:
Why the fuck you take so long to answer my message?
The fuck you gon' tell me?
Oh, you with the homies?
Don't even think you can curve me for some other pussy
'Cause it can get ugly
Boy, I be on some other shit
Just lettin' you know wassup
'Cause if I ever find out 'bout that other bitch
Boy, you gon' get that bitch cut
I'm not the one
I don't know why would you try it
Trust me, my nigga, just know I will beat all of them judges
I swear I'm not lyin'
Pussy was good
Pussy was perfect
But watch when I pop all ya tires and key up ya whip
Like, "I hope it was worth it"

Leave that bitch alone
Leave that bitch alone
You knew that I was crazy
Why the fuck you took her home?
Now I'm goin' through your phone
Seein' all these hoes
You knew that I don't like her
What type of crazy shit you on?

What if I tell you I wanna be wifey?
What you gon' tell me, I might be?
Then I'ma want ya password to ya Twitter, ya Facebook
And even ya IG
Boy, it's a wrap
'Cause I got the gat
And I will blow all them bitches that's all in ya DMs
Just don't call me back, nigga
Please don't be dumb
My hair always in a bun
You know what that means, I'll be ready for war
And remember I got a gun
I be on some other shit
Just lettin' you know from now
So when that time come around and I do catch you lackin'
Move outta town
I'm tellin' you
I don't be with all that crying
If I get her or you fuck with motions

Pussy was good
Pussy was perfect
But if I ever pop up on you fuckin' that bitch
Boy, you gon' need a surgeon

Leave that bitch alone
Leave that bitch alone
You knew that I was crazy
Why the fuck you took her home?
Now I'm goin' through your phone
Seein' all these hoes
You knew that I don't like her
What type of crazy shit you on?

Leave that bitch alone

***data\songs_individual\Cardi B_Red Barz.txt***

Uh, yeah
Some regular-degular bloody bars, blap

I swear to God, they ain't wanna see me leave the club
Got up on my shit, now they scared to show me love
They'd rather see me on the pole twerkin' it for dubs
I guess I really gotta show them what the fuck is up
I'm on some other shit, that Cardi B gutta shit
Every time I catch a hating bitch, she on her stutter shit
Punk can't finish her words, but on Instagram thuggin' shit
You set yourself up, don't make it seem like I be buggin', bitch
And niggas hatin' on me really be upset
I don't know, make me wonder what you got between your legs
You a real nigga mad at a bitch for getting bread?
You's a bitch from birth, you just grew a third leg, woo
Bite down, bite down, it was crunch time
Yeah, I skip all of them bitches in the lunch line
I put in work, now I'm here at the front line
Ready for the bullshit, I swear it's on my bloodline
Touch mine, getting slumped, slime, one time
Pump blind, bitches quit, then I dump mine
Pull up with the Gucci clutch, spitting clutch rhymes
Flyer than a big, big B with a Blood tie
Don't do much, he get hard when I bust wines
No straws for this juice box, gulp one time
Last nigga I was with went insane
'Cause my head game over hills like I'm lookin' for the sunshine
I'm a Bronx bitch, birth of the hip-hop
From the block to the tick-tock in the Patek watch
Quick drop with the cash, couldn't fit the Ziploc
Grips locked, get your shit popped in my flip flops
Wealthy now, but every dollar, I still want it all
Now he wanna nail me, I could give your man a cure
You gotta mail me, but I don't check my spam at all
Never feel what you're sayin' like I'm usin' Anbesol
Travel all around the states getting nice checks
I was tourin' off a tape, I had a hype set
Is that the reason all these niggas wanna pipe next?
I'm a creep, bitch, see his dick through his Nike Techs
Got 'em all scared and I ain't even strike yet
Wire up jaws when I swing if the mic stretch
I worked hard, took the right steps
Had a shot so I took the shit, now this game gon' need a life vest
Uh
I said, woo
Huh
Blap

***data\songs_individual\Cardi B_Trust Issues.txt***

I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back, that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more
Getting all this money made my heart so cold
Middle finger up to you hoes
Hating on me, I'm making moves on the road though
And I don't really trust them no more
I don't really stress it no more
I don't be trusting them, I don't be trusting them
I don't be stressing them, I don't be stressing them
I swear I just flex on them, I swear I just flex on them
I swear I just flex on them, I swear I just flex on them

Carbi B, me, bad one
You bitches, sad ones
I just get my money and I style on them
All them bitches broke and they mad I just dab on them
Wave bye, hit the gas on them
200 on the dash on them
I don't say much, I just swag on them
I be killin' them, I go Fab on them
Left right, throwing jabs at them
Night night, I'ma black on them
Hit the game raw, no Magnums
Can't stop winning, God, finna go platinum
I don't really trust them no more
All these bitches do is talk behind your back, that's a no go
And I don't really stress it no more
Getting all this money made my heart so cold

You must be drunk off all of those liqs
