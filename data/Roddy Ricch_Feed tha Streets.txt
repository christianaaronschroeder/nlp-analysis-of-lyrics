Whoa, ooh
Whoa, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Most these niggas ain’t tryna see you win
And I can’t trust nobody
Not interested in being friends
It’s free all of my niggas till my niggas free again
Went in blind through these Cartier’s I can see again
I’m Roddy Ricch but I remember back when I was broke
Niggas' strugglin' on that dollar menu now it’s full course
Went from standing on that corner, now I’m standing on a boat
Bitch I bossed up, I done gave a lot of niggas hope
Yeah aye be careful who you choose lil' nigga
My youngin grab a stick with the tool lil' nigga
Really thuggin' so you better keep it cool lil' nigga
Grab your backpack and go to school lil' nigga
Cause these streets ain’t for everybody
You lose your niggas in the coldest ways
You take the L, the snitch get forty days
Your bitch be gone like, "Andale"
My niggas tired of being underpaid
So we trapping for a  hundred days nigga
I remember I was certified broke
And I got up off my ass started juggin' for a note
Young nigga hit a stain and got washed up
Free my niggas on the game they got locked up
I pour a pint for all my niggas who can’t shine with me
And pour up Ace for all my niggas who alive with me
And fuck a nigga who ain’t tryna take the time with me
And take my niggas worldwide if they grind with me
Where were you when I was broke, being broke was so annoying
When these other niggas shining but you know you can’t afford it
So I be trapping heavy from the night until the morning
State prison took my niggas we just tryna pay the mortgage
How they all make count with all these cases
Talking bout my struggle but you know I ain’t complacent
I was sixteen when I got it out the basement
And Bird seen the vision yeah we gotta make it
Certified broke but the name rich
Producers talking touchdown but they ain’t switch
And if a nigga switched up I don’t blame shit
Don’t got no time for a nigga or a lame bitch
Diving in 'bout to cop a whole Wraith on these niggas
I go to Ruth Chris cause I’m 'bout to eat steak on these niggas
I take the charge so they won’t stack one more case on my nigga
We surviving cause this shit ain’t gon make it my nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
