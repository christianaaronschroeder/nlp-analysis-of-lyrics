I've been searching something like this

I've been trying to not tell you things
I've been thinking for some reason to shut up
But baby you know I'm not like this
I can´t make my mind stop thinking about ya
When I met you I was tired of that shit
That I make my heart don't work anymore
But finally I ended at your bed
Since the first time, boy you show me real love
Oye bebé vente pa' mi casa
Date prisa ya, no sé porqué tardas
Cómprame cositas made in Taiwan
Curro cuatro horitas

Tell me how you like it
The way you do me
I want to ride the Kawasaki
Hit me at half past five
I've been waiting for you, papi
I want you to tell me that you love me

Vamos a la calle
Vamos a pasear
Todas las chicas miran
Empiezan a envidiar
Soy a lo que aspiran
Se les va a pasar
Yo no tengo odio
A mi me va genial
