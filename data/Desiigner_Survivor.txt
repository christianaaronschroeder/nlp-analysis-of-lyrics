Survivor through the day
We gon' survive this, on the gang
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
Baby, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I've been through fire, fire, flame
Now I'm icy, Krispy Kreme
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
Baby, I ain't worried 'bout a thing

I survived through the bottom then I made it to the top (Top)
Now I got the white Wraith with the cherry top (Cherry top)
And my boo, she get everything I got (Thing I got)
The carnival, like basketball season, we ball out
They try to divide us like Biggie and Pac (Pac)
Nowaday the media be tryna call the shots (Call the shots)
That fast scoop, yeah that demon I bring out (Skrrt, skrrt)
That mask too, if you act out, I spazz out

Numb to the way, I been through fire, flame
Gone again and gone through all that pain (Pain)
I had some niggas put some dirt up on my name
Baby, we can't separate (No)
I'm a Lambo driver, babe
I'm a stone cold survivor, babe
I wanna be free and fly miles away (Way)
Baby, we could fly far away (Way)
Survivor through the day
We gon' survive this, on the gang (Gang)

I've been through fire, fire, flame
Now I'm icy, Krispy Kreme (Ice)
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
Baby, I ain't worried 'bout a thing

I see stores, they runnin' out of food
I been stayin' in the house
We say hospitals runnin' out of beds
The world is goin' in a drought (In a drought)
I just wanna make it out
And you know everything I do, yeah, ain't for clout
I just wanna make it out
We are the survivors, no we can't be stopped (Stopped)
Praise out to them people up in Italy, on God (Praise on God)
We notice you, I give every prayer I got (Prayer I got)
These prayers on you, we know family or we die
We see Trump on the news goin' crazy (Crazy)
USA people goin' crazy (Crazy)
We just all 'tryna see another day
From this world, no, we ain't 'tryna separate
I just got me a Rari, babe
A house for us to party, babe
We gon' go out, we gon' celebrate
After this we gon' fly away (Fly away)

Survivor through the day
