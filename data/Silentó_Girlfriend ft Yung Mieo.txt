We went to middle school
Shе used to ride my bus
She was my first girl
My first crush
Momma said focus on your books you ain't got timе for girls
No time for girls
No time for girls
We laughed, we talked, we tried to work it out
She said Mieo I think we need to break up
So we broke up and now she wanna make up
I don't wanna make up
I gotta new chick but don't nobody know
She told me that she wanna keep it on a d-low
I gotta new chick but don't nobody know
She told me that she wanna keep it on a down low
She was my girlfriend
My first girlfriend
We used to be friends
I gotta new friend
But ain't gone tell nobody
But ain't gone tell nobody
But ain't gone tell nobody

I gotta new friend
But ain't gone tell nobody
But ain't gone tell nobody
But ain't gone tell nobody
Tell nobody, tell nobody, tell nobody

We was just rocking strong
Always on the phone
When I was home alone
I never did her wrong
She always sing my song
When we was on the phone
The next day she lost her tone I started moving on
She got mad, She got mad at me
But I don't care about it
I found my next lil hottie
And she just really like me
And so it ain't no stopping
What we got going on ain't your business
Her friend stay mad so I got her mad
I'ma always keep em' sad
Because the lust stays in the past
Stays in the past
Stays in the past
She was my girlfriend
My first girlfriend
We used to be friends
I gotta new friend
But ain't gone tell nobody
But ain't gone tell nobody
But ain't gone tell nobody
But ain't gone tell nobody
She was my girlfriend
My first girlfriend
We used to be friends
I gotta new friend
But ain't gone tell nobody
But ain't gone tell nobody
But ain't gone tell nobody
Tell nobody, tell nobody, tell nobody
