Oh Lord, Jetson made another one

You don't love me, don't tell me you love me
'Cause I can go fuck on your friend
I can hook up with your buddy
I ain't got time to pretend
I'm tryna get me some cuddy
And I ain’t really tryna be friends
I'd rather get to the money

I tried to talk to the ho
Told her my dreams and she looked at me funny (Ah)
Everything I done dreamed I done done it (Yeah)
Everything I done dreamed I done done it (Yeah)
Now I done it, it's time for some more dreams (Yeah)
Run it up, I need some more cream (Ho)

Still sellin' P's to promoters (Yeah)

She don't really love me, she acting (Acting)
I'm treating the show like the streets (Streets)

You don't love me, don't tell me you love me

He keep on blowing her phone up
Press the red button, ignore him (Aha)

Sucks for you, you ain't believe me

They wanted my heart and my soul
I stay on my grind and I grow
