15 will get you 20
(it getcha 10)
Don't think it can't happen to you
(Claudette C'mon)
(ohh ooo)
15 will get you 20
(twenty.. it getcha 10)
Don't think it can happen to you
(City High C'mon)
18 fresh out of school doin' the right thing
Playin' by the rules (ya know the flava)
But one day she caught his eye
36 - 24 with the skirt size 5
Stepped to her and asked her name
Not even thinkin' to ask her age
She so fine she had to be grown
Had he known then what he knows now
She was only 16 with the body of a 20 year old beauty queen
Man Oh Man how could this be
So damn fly but only 16
Chorus
15 will getcha 20
16 will getcha 10
Don't think it can't happen to you
Cuz it happened to one of my friends
(uh huh uh huh)
(better believe it)
CHORUS
15 will getcha 20
16 will getcha 10
Don't think it can't happen to you
Cuz it happened to one of my friends
(City High c'mon)
Let me tell ya bout my friend Genie..
1997 homecoming queen
Workin' hard on her degree
But then one hot day she was out at the beach
There he was about 5 foot 9
Choclate tango in the middle of july
So fine he had the lips of a vintage wine
If she knew then what she knows now
He was only 16
With the body of a god and the face of a king
Man oh man how could this be
So damn fine but only 16
CHORUS
This is a ghetto tale
I'm on stage with my gazelle
I spotted her through the lens
A young cinderell
Ya know one of them girls that start street wars
With C-4's and 4-4's I met her on tour
She said 'can i take a draw of ya spliff..cool i got a suite up at the palace
'enough cannabis but the chick didn't mention now i'm in prison
Feelin like anthony mason
Chorus(2x)
