A short time ago
In a galaxy closely, closely near (Is it closely?)
(Yeah, it's closely, just keep the evil voice!)
Oh, oh, I'm sorry for party rocking
I've been sipping on that whiskey all day (Just read it!)
Two men emerged out of the muck
April 1, 2007, April Fools' Day
It marked the birth of a new sound, Party Rock
And what we do is rock the beat!
(It's going down!)
'Cause we LMFAO, rock the beat and rock the show
Move your feet onto the floor, start to freak and drink some more
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
If you came to party put your motherfucking hands up!
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
If you came to party put your motherfucking hands up!
