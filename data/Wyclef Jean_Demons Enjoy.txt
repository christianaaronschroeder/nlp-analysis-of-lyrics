Your day comes
As my night falls
In my hotel
You’re in california
True love
Is a miscall
Can’t find time to talk
But I swear I’ll die for you
FaceTime
Send pics
Ask for the romance
I’ll show you my phone bill
Distance
It’s just a short flight
So we’ll pretend we don’t feel the divide

Hell on earth
Heaven ain’t too far
Demons enjoy
We’re all on earth
Tell me what we’re really searching for
Either way you’ll end up at the door
Hell on earth
Heaven ain’t too far
Demons enjoy
We’re all on earth
Tell me what we’re really searching for
Either way you’ll end up at the door
When the day comes
And the night falls
In a hotel In California
When the ground splits
Right between us
And the stars are born for the dreamers
As she talks to the mirror
Make me a believer
With a tattoo of a lover
With a flag and a gun

Hell on earth
Heaven ain’t too far
Demons enjoy
We’re all on earth
Tell me what we’re really searching for
Either way you’ll end up at the door
Hell on earth
Heaven ain’t too far
Demons enjoy
We’re all on earth
Tell me what we’re really searching for
Either way you’ll end up at the door
I’m a point guard on earth
Seconds left on screen
Fans start to cheer
For the trophy and the ring
Glory days disappear
It won’t take the love from us
We’re childish gambinos
In America
Sweet 16
Lean with a cup
Breathe, baby breathe
Momma like, please wake up
I, can’t sleep
But at night I dream
Still water runs deep in the stream

Hell on earth
Heaven ain’t too far
Demons enjoy
We’re all on earth
Tell me what we’re really searching for
Either way you’ll end up at the door
Hell on earth
Heaven ain’t too far
Demons enjoy
We’re all on earth
Tell me what we’re really searching for
Either way you’ll end up at the door
Your day comes
As my night falls
In my hotel
You’re in California
