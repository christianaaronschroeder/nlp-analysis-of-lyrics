I'll give anything for love
Just to be with you
And girl I swear I'll never change
The way you are
Cause I will be there

It's only right that you be mine
Cause you
Are my angel from above girl
Angel from above

Everytime I close my eyes
I thank the lord that I've found you
And girl I swear I'll never change
Your my dream come true
Cause I will be there
I will be there for you
Forever more
I wanna share my life
It's only right that you be mine
Cause you
Are my angel from above girl
Angel from above
And you
