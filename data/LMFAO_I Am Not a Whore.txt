I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
But I like to do it
Most girls I meet are quite savage
Always tryin' to grab up on my package
They say I look yummy and they want a taste
But I'm a human, not a sandwich
Sometimes I feel like LL Cool J
I need love not random booty
But every girl I try to get to know
Ends up tryin' to do me

I said
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
But I like to do it

Sometimes, I just wanna dance
Girl I know you like my style
But get your hand out my pants
I am not a whore
(No no no)
I am not a whore
(I'm not your hoe)
I am not a whore
(I just love the music)
I am not a whore
(But I like to do it)

I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
I am not a whore
