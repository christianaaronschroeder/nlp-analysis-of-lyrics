Baby, we need to talk
You know, you know our relationship ain't really been going right
I don't really know how to tell you this but
I'm leaving you for the groove

Baby, I gotta let you know
There's something inside of me, girl, that I can't control
Now I love you, baby
And I always will
But that ain't strong enough to change the way that I feel
No

You gave me attitude, when all I do is for you
Well find another dude, I'm tired of being your fool

So
I'm leaving you for the groove
Finally making my move
Now that I'm finally free
I just wanna be me
Yeah, yeah
I'm leaving you for the groove
Finally making my move
Now that I'm finally free
I just wanna be me
Yeah, yeah, aw
Baby, I'm done playing your game
Every time I'm dancing, you just look at me strange
I was the one that you loved, now I'm the one the you hate
Well, I don't care girl, go ahead, take me off your top 8
'Cause

I'm leaving you for the groove
Making my move
Now that I'm finally free
I just wanna be me
Yeah, yeah
I'm leaving you for the groove
Making my move
Now that I'm finally free
I just wanna be me
Yeah, yeah, aw
Dance
I'm leaving you for the groove
