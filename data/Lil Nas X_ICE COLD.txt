Lyrics from Snippet

Da da da da da da da
Da da da da
Daytrip took it to ten, hey

Tell me it's cold, baby, I said ice cold
Tell me it's cold, baby, I said ice cold
...

...
I'm cryin' with the doves, oh (Brrum)
See, I can make a hit that you can play
And I can make 'em sing it every day, every day, hey
And I know all of this is meant for me
Turn tomorrows into the todays

I'm fighting someone I can't see (Can't see me)
I'm fighting someone I can't be (Can't be me)
