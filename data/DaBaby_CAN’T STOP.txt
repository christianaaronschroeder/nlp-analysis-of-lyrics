Fuck you talkin' 'bout, nigga?

Bitch, it ain't no stopping no nigga like me
This the intro, watch me get into it (Let's go)
Bitches call me a cutie, I'm groovy
My daughter took care of forever off music (Muah)
Screaming, "Fly high," to Kobe, Gianna, we ballin'
I can't tell you shit about losin' (R.I.P.)
Finger fuck allegations, keep hatin'
I'm patiently waitin' on niggas to prove it (You bitch)
Bitch, you know I turn piss into lemonade
Turn shit into sugar, that's chocolate pudding
Let you know I don't fuck with you anyway (Hmmgh)
Know I keep getting better, you thought that I wouldn't
I'ma keep lettin' off, I'm a renegade
The media blitzed and I took off and shook 'em
Came out like a boss and they feel a way (Ha)
Gon' end up gettin' fucked, you keep thinkin' I'm pussy
Bitch, I'm 'bout my business, it's all about timin'
When I put this shit on, I don't cop from no stylist
I'm all on the TV and net, I'm too viral
I pull up with a vibe, when we hop out, we vibin'
I like movin' in silence, don't bother nobody
He come bother me, I'ma catch me a body
I don't get into politics, I just be poppin' shit
Obviously hot as a motherfuckin' fire (Hot)
Let me cool off a minute
I got nothin' to hide, I don't run from my problems
Just tryna get you out my business (You bitch)
Only answer to God, I'm already convicted
If I'm havin' you as my witness (Uh-huh)
Having hoes at my shows, tryna take off they clothes
I don't know what to do with them bitches (Let's go, huh)
You know it's Baby, nigga
Let's go
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me, let's go
Oh, no, bitch
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me (I just can't motherfuckin' stop, man)
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me (I just can't stop)
Let's go, bitch (And they can't motherfuckin' stop me)
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me (I know this shit frustratin', man, like I know)
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me, bitch
(I know it's frustratin' for you niggas, dawg)

Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me (Ain't no stoppin' no nigga like me)
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me

Verse two
You do what you want when you poppin' (Let's pop)
Guess I do what I want, plus I'm single as fuck
See my boo in the cut, I got options (Muah)
Know I'm all up her skirt like a stockin' (Mmm)
My album make hoes call me Kirk like my mama
I see how they peepin' the technique and jockin'
All these icy VVS on my neck, let's play hockey (Bling, bling)
I'm guessin' that he brought a stick, 'cause I brought a stick (Yeah)
And I ain't the type to be payin' for pussy
I fuck hoes for free, never bought a bitch
Hold me up to the sun, I'm not counterfeit (Yeah, yeah)
I just got a new gun from my bottom bitch
And I'm ready to slang it, I'm armed and I'm dangerous (Boom, boom, boom)
Come fuckin' with me, better find a ditch
And throw yourself in it 'cause that's how I'm living
When I get in my feelings, I make niggas feel it
When I hit yo lil' bitch, I put dick in her kidneys
On a date with my new ho, I took her to Wendy's
We ain't going in, get that shit from the window
Take that ho through the drive-thru
Keep playin' me like a ho, we gon' slide through
It's cool, I'ma let you act up on the internet
Let's see you niggas act tough when I find you
Bitch ass nigga and umm...
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me, huh?
Nah, bitch (Fuck)
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Let's go, bitch
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me

Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me (Or a bitch, can't no bitch or no bitch ass nigga stop this shit, dawg)
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
