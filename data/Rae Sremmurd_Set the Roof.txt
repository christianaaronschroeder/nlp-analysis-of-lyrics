Mike WiLL, fuck with me
(Mustard on the beat, hoe)

We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire

We set the roof, we set the roof
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof, we set the roof
We set the roof on fire

If I'm not mistaken, all my niggas made it
Two 3's on my feet then I pump fake it
Baby girl grab the Quavo then french kiss it
Swae Leeâ€”Mr. Couldn't Take Your Bitch Quicker
Hottest niggas on the planet, got the place lit up
Fly niggas, got expensive taste, sight and touch
I am not your nigga, you got me fucked up
Bought your bitch the bra that make her tits sit up
I only fit in with the niggas who stand out
Money talks, you just poppin' off at the mouth
If I'm the topic, then the conversation heated
Rae Sremm gettin' booked up in every city
Splash her with cash, had to spazz on the waiter
She fucked up my order three times in a row, woah
I'm good on gas, I just filled up my tank
Now let's fill up her head and let's see if she chokes

We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire

We set the roof, we set the roof
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof, we set the roof
We set the roof on fire

Slim!
Two bad bitches swimmin' in my bed
Off with their head, off, off with their head
Young Slim fuckin' bitches in my infrared
Come and hit the propane, I just lit the gas
Young wild niggas, livin' fast
Stash your money in a brown paper bag
We set the roof on fire, then we flood it out
We just threw the money up, we ain't even count
Shake it like a seizure, bustin' in my speeder
Girl I'm bustin' off the gasoline, it's fuckin' up my speech
I'm a million dollar nigga, baby nothin's of my reach
I'm a million dollar nigga like I hit the lottery
Splash her with cash, had to spazz on the waitress
She fucked up my order three times in a row
I'm good on gas, I just filled up my tank
Now let's fill up her head and let's see if she goes

We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
We set the roof on fire
