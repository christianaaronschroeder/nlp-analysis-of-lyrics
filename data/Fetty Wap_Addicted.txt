Tryna chill with you, tryna roll my dope
I love the way you smile, I love the way you are
I love the way your pretty eyes so sexy
And anything you wanna know, just ask me
H-Here’s everything you need, girl I got it
But, you ain’t tripping, see them hundreds in your pocket baby
Your pretty brown skin sweeter than a swisher
I’ma lay you down, slow and treat it
I’m rapping for your treasure, ain’t worried ‘bout your exes
I can do it better, your pussy, yeah it’s set
Wet, wet and wetter, wrap your legs around my neck
Til I stop breathing, put that pussy in my face
Remind me why I need it
I’ma have you shaking like you having many seizures
We gon do some crazy things, tell me could you see it?
Tryna have my daughter with you, baby is you with it?
Tr-Tryna have my daughter with you, baby is you with it?
Tr-Tryna have my daughter with you, baby is you with it?
Tr-Tryna have my daughter with you, baby is you with it?

And I ain’t ever lacking, I’m always in the field
Of course, I have some hoes
Name a nigga who don’t, a nigga had to wife it
Name a nigga who won’t, you ever have a problem
The chopper on pump
And every time I see you, see you for the first time
And every time we sexing, we always showing off
Say girl you something special, no rationale about you
The only girl I ever love should come from you
And I ain’t rushing girl, we are comfortable
Both of our hair is turning gray, I’m growing old with you
