Sixteen on my own, young nigga being grown
Couldn't trap, I had to rob niggas
Cause I ain't even have a phone
I was tryna be a man, got me feeling all alone
Ain't nobody to the right side
So I had to go and do some wrong
You don't know my struggle, niggas tryna eat
Damn, Top Ramen for a week
Nigga barely even had a sheet
Boy, I wasn't rocking no designers
Had the same Jordans on my feet
I was talking 'bout being rich, nigga
When broke was really me, yeah
Swear to God they love to hate
They'll fake it to your face
They just wanna see you fall off
They ain't tryna see you get the cake
I remember I was starving
Fake twenties, had to bust 'em
I was serving got the lean on me
Had to stretch it out, Robitussin

Roddy Ricch, nigga, that's the stage name
Yesterday I was just Roddy broke
But if rap fall, back to bank scam
Robbing niggas and selling the dope
Back in high school, I was fucked up
I'm like, "How I'm gon' pay for the bus?"
So at night time I has hittin' licks to pay my phone bill for the month
Still, I'll lookout for a nigga
Go and  take the top bunk
Streets knowin' I'm a lil' nigga
But I ain't never been a punk
Most time I was on the floor
Use a coat for a pillow
To a five star hotel, one day gon' feel it
Now it's back to the floor
Up and down got me seasick
Hope God lookout for me
One day I'ma be rich
So I stay prayed up
Forgive me for the way I came up, yeah
Ayy
