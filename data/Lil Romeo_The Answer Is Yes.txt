Baby don't worry
Don't worry about a thing at all
I'll give you answers
To the questions... you've been looking for
There is no reason
For you to feel sad and insecure
It makes it harder
For me...to open the door
If they ask me if you got my heart
The answer is yes, the answer is yes
There's no question I think I've been blessed
If I must confess, I will confess
Are you standing there with so much love
In my heart, I'm blessed
Are you sure there ain't no doubt
The answer is yes
The answer is yes
So won't you come closer
Closer to the road that's been build for you
And me
As wild as a river...of love
That runs through my veins
If they ask me if you got my heart
The answer is yes, the answer is yes
There's no question I think I've been blessed
If I must confess, I will confess
Every day, I am waiting for you baby
Every night, baby I'm falling
Baby I'm falling in love
Oh oh oh oh oh I'm falling
Baby I'm falling
If they ask me if you got my heart
The answer is yes, the answer is yes
There's no question I think I've been blessed
If I must confess, I will confess
Are you standing there with so much love
In my heart, I'm blessed
Are you sure there ain't no doubt
Are you sure there ain't no doubt
The answer is yes
