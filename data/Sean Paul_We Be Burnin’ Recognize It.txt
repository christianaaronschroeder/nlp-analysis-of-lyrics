Just gimme the gees an we be clubbin', yo (Clubbin', yo)
Gyal a make we please and we be thuggin' now (Thuggin' now)
Sippin' Hennessy and we be bubblin', yo (Bubblin', yo)
Set yuh mind at ease, we gotta take it slow
So when you see the S.P. floatin', don't provoke him
'Cause the girls we were pokin' ganja smokin'
Best thing for the recreation
We get the best girls in a every nation
Topper girls we promotin' and supportin'
And them love how we flow, king hear them shouting
First class ticket invitation
Gyal from New York, England and Jamaican, every day

We be burnin'
Not concernin' what nobody wanna say
We be earnin'
Dollars turning cah' we mind de pon we pay
More than gold and oil and diamonds
Girls, we need them every day
Recognize it
We pimpin' as we riding

Girls them a page me want to raise me
True me write enough tune and drive them crazy
Well I man a true born Jamaican
Ready fi di girls them in every situation
We a the gyal them pro, them know we flow
With the lyrical content that make them dip low and
Make the club keep jumpin'
Turn up the bass when you hear this pumpin'
Summertime bounce to the music people choose it
Sean the P gal a cruise with well reputed
'Cause we a the girls them champion
Got 'nuff a dem like the great king Solomon
Many girls in my eyesight sexy dress type
Se them ready for a hype night, just gimme the light
And, make we blaze it
The roof, we haffi raise it again
We be burnin'
Not concernin' what nobody wanna say
We be earnin'
Dollars turning cah' we mind de pon we pay
More than gold and oil and diamonds
Girls, we need them every day
Recognize it
Pimpin' as we riding

Just gimme the gees an we be clubbin', yo (Clubbin', yo)
