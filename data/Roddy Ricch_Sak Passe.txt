Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ha (CashMoneyAP)
Yeah, yeah, uh, hey, hey
I feed the streets
I feed the streets, yeah
I feed the streets
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Joey Trife)

We fed the streets, I had to flood it
Patek Phillipe, I wanna bus' it
She fuck with me just 'cause I can buy that luggage
And now they recognize me when I'm out in public
Them Haitians fuck with me, so they say "sak pase"
I'm in the Benz but I can’t wait to cop that Wraith
I came from nothing, nigga, I cannot be fake
I was hungry now try kitchen make my plate, aye

Go get a bag, lil' nigga
Pop a couple tags, lil' nigga
Hop out that Jag, lil' nigga
Fuck around and do the dash, lil' nigga
I remember I was broke
I remember I was starving
We was selling that dope
Bagging front of them apartments
We fed the streets, I had to flood it
Patek Phillipe, I wanna bus' it
She fuck with me just 'cause I can buy that luggage
And now they recognize me when I'm out in public
Them Haitians fuck with me, so they say "sak pase"
I'm in the Benz but I can’t wait to cop that Wraith
I came from nothing, nigga, I cannot be fake
I was hungry now try kitchen make my plate, aye

Lil' shorty make it a theme song
She wanna fuck with my jeans on
Play with them ball like ping pong
Bust in her jaw I ain’t even know
I wanna fuck with my niggas
Then take my niggas to the top of the world
All my niggas foreign, when we pull up, skrrt
Light skin with a nice body looking like Nia Long
Private head with the private pussy looking like FlySavion
Rich sex, having rich sex on the nights we alone
Chain glowing in the mirror looking like a ice cream cone

We fed the streets, I had to flood it
Patek Phillipe, I wanna bus' it
She fuck with me just 'cause I can buy that luggage
And now they recognize me when I'm out in public
Them Haitians fuck with me, so they say "sak pase"
I'm in the Benz but I can’t wait to cop that Wraith
I came from nothing, nigga, I cannot be fake
I was hungry now try kitchen make my plate, aye
