We got London on da Track
My voice kinda fucked up for this one (Uh, uh)
Yeah

They thought it was over 'til I pulled up in the drop
I ran the light and hit the gas (Yeah, yeah)
She like it when I hit her with my chain on and my watch (Yes, sir)
She say, "Record," I use the flash with it (Yeah)
She always been a good girl, but she fuck me like a thot (Okay)
I take my time, I have her blastin' (Yeah)
She know that nigga think he fuckin' with me, but he not
She say I'm nothin' like her last nigga

Thought that it was over, but I'm back now
I run up them racks and now them hoes know how to act now
Looking for the truth? You found a nigga
Thought I was a one hit wonder 'til I dropped the album, didn't it?
Thought I was just like you 'til I bought a new car
Pull up in that bitch, like vroom
And I dropped your boo off
You'll probably pick her up later
I probably pick up a quarter million and shit on a hater
And it ain't a nigga gave me shit, but I did plenty of favors
I'm talking favors
Favors you ain't deserve and you ain't want that (Yeah, yeah)
Passin' out these loans that I don't want back (Yeah, yeah)
By the time you cross the line, I let you go back (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And now I pull up, drop the window, yell out
They thought it was over 'til I pulled up in the drop (Let's go)
I ran the light and hit the gas (Yeah, yeah)
She like it when I hit her with my chain on and my watch (Yes, sir)
She say, "Record," I use the flash with it (Yeah)
She always been a good girl, but she fuck me like a thot (Okay)
I take my time, I have her blastin' (Yeah)
She know that nigga think he fuckin' with me, but he not
She say I'm nothin' like her last nigga (Yeah)

Look, I ain't trippin', I already got more money than my opps
I'm just trying to get more money than last year
Don't argue with 'em, we take care of any problem that we got
I just hope when it's over, you got my back, uh-huh
And I ain't nothin' like your last
Look, I ain't nothing like your last nigga, you buggin', I run it up
Had to stack my bread up, I was sick of feelin' regular
Niggas out here drillin' her and you worried about impressin' her (Yeah)
I swear he's not me
If he ain't with the shits, then he not with me (Yeah)
I'm icy as a motherfucker, golly
Why the fuck wouldn't they wanna rob me?

They thought it was over 'til I pulled up in the drop
I ran the light and hit the gas (Yeah, yeah)
She like it when I hit her with my chain on and my watch (Yes, sir)
She say, "Record," I use the flash with it (Yeah)
She always been a good girl, but she fuck me like a thot (Okay)
I take my time, I have her blastin' (Yeah)
She know that nigga think he fuckin' with me, but he not
She say I'm nothin' like her last nigga (Yeah)
