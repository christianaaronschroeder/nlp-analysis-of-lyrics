Hello, good morning, tell me what the lick read
Pretty face, thin waist, with the sick weave
First time fish tailing in the 6, speed
Real bad boy, tell 'em come and get me
I'm at the fight, been kinda like Bellmen
Only took the trip to the truck twice
Unpacked the Mac 11 and air max’s
Stuff six figures in my damn air mattress
Uh, I’m in love with large bills
A dime with a fat ass, thin waist, and tall heels
Yeah, it’s the Teflon Don
Hundred carats in the charm, trying to give it back to Sean

Hello, good morning
Lets go, lets ride
Hello, good morning
Hello, good morning
Know you’ve been waiting for it
’Cause I seen you watching
So let's go
Lets get it popping

'Cause I’ve been leaning on the bar
Looking cleaner than the star
All these broads won't give me my props
25 on the bank, I be stunting on their ass
And they mad 'cause the bitch won’t stop
Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
Stuntin like you looking like a movie
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
And everybody know who the truth be
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
I blow 'cause I’m blowing on the ohh wee
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
Hello

I just came up in it a little bit self-centered
But did I kill a Queen?
Now Alexander McQueen’s got the wrists on glow
The bottles is on po’
Got that shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy yo
What the fuck I look like? Bitch, I run this town
I ain’t coming out for less than a hunnid thou'
Man, the last time I checked, I was bubbling out
'Bout to turn down shows out in Dublin now
Wait, wait, hol' up, maybe they ain't get that there
Like eleven hundred horses when I switch that gear
I just swerve on them, sorta like I missed that deer
Then I press that little button on the sit back chair
Bitch, I do it 'cause I get it
I got billion dollar credit
If you got a million dollars, you could put it up and bet it
I just be like, "Hello, hello" but I never could salute them
Young money, I do it for the youth dem
Hello, Good morning
Lets go, lets ride
Hello, Good morning
Hello, Good evening
You blow, you feindin’
’Vause you know that your really needed
And I’m the one that you wanna be with
But right now baby you dreaming
Wake up and turn the lights off

'Cause I’ve been leaning on the bar
Looking cleaner than the star
All these broads won't give me my props
25 on the bank, I be stunting on their ass
And they mad 'cause the bitch won’t stop

Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
Stuntin like you looking like a movie
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
And everybody know who the truth be
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
I blow 'cause I’m blowing on the ohh wee
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
