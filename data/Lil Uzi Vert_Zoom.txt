Wheezy Beats

No, I will not answer
Please do not do call my phone
Mr. Do-Not-Answer-Phone
Please don't girl, no, leave me 'lone
Double cup, it's styrofoam
Pull up, my car, it go vroom
This a coupe, no-no legroom
Pull up on your bitch like zoom

What, you thought that I wasn't gon' come through?
What you thought, I wasn't gon' get comfortable?
You know I wouldn't do this if it wasn't you

Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah-yeah
I know what I can and what I can't do

I know every time that I'ma come through
Yeah, I just turned to the big man
Big shoes, big hands, counting big bands
Big B on the back of my new pants
She saw the zippers and said, "Those are some sick pants"
Ooh, I cop Balmain by the flurry
I got all this money nowadays so I can't worry
Breathe in, breathe out, so a bitch can't ’sturb me
Size 29 my jeans but my clip is a .30
No, I will not answer
Please do not do call my phone

Ooh, I'ma get it, run it up, have no choice
I'ma sing 'til I got no voice
I don't fuck with you boys

I know every time that I'ma come through
