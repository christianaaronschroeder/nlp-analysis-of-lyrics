How many people out there like Donny Hathaway?
Let me see your hands up
Know what I'm sayin'
City High's about to reminisce
Drop the beat y'all
I'v been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs
I made some bad rhymes
Acted all my life in stages
10,000 people watching
We're alone now
And I'm singin' this song to you
I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be
I treated you unkindly
Darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Baby you see through me
We're alone now
And was singing this song for you
You taught me precious secrets
Of a true love with holding nothing
Came out in front while I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
If my words don't seem to come together
Listen to the melody
Cause my love was in there hiding yeah
City High to the bridge now
Aaaaaah
I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
You're a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
Cause we were alone
And I was singing this song to you
We were alone
