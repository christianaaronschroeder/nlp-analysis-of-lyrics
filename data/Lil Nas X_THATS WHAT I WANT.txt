One, two, three, four

Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
That afro black boy with the gold teeth
He dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, he comin' over to me, yeah

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missin' out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I want (I), someonе to love me
I need (I), someonе who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want (I), someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want
Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind (My mind)
I need a baby while I'm in my prime
Need an adversary to my down and weary
Like, tell me that's life when I'm stressin' at night
Be like, "You'll be okay" and, "Everything is alright," uh
Love me or nothin' 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missin' out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I want (I), someone to love me
I need (I), someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want (I), someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

I want (I), someone to love me
I need (I), someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want (I), someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want
