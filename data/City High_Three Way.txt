Now the way it went
Got me in this messed up predicament
Cause I ain't know how to be monogamous
I was caught in the wrong
Just walking through the mall with a shorty on my arm
Now I played the fool
Sitting in the sneaker store buying shoes
My girl's best friend came strolling through
I tried to turn away but I moved to late
Cause she already saw my face
I was hoping she
Didn't really get a good look at me
She walked out the store so casually
I thought that I was fine
Till she called me later on with my girl on the line
She seen me
Call me up on the 3-way (3-way)
Giving my girl the whole replay (Whole replay)
Has it happened to you? (Has it happened to you?)
She seen me (Bone diggy dig on bone)
Call me up on the 3-way (Bone diggy dig on bone)
Giving my girl the whole replay (Bone diggy dig on bone)
Tell me what to do (Bone diggy dig on bone)

Now I tried to lie
Said that it must have been some other guy
You know your friends jealous of you and I
She ain't got a man, so she's all in our business
Shut up and let me finish girl!
You crushing me
Acting like you ain't got no trust in me
I thought you said that you was in love with me
Well act like you know me
Hang up the phone, tell your girl leave us alone
But she ain't quit
The more I try to lie, the angrier she get
Told me it was over with us, that's it
Word to all men:
If you gon' be out creeping
Look out for her friend
She seen me (Woah-ohhh, yeah)
Call me up on the 3-way
Giving my girl the whole replay  (Replay)
Has it happened to you? (Has it happened to you?)
She seen me (Bone diggy dig on bone)
Call me up on the 3-way (Bone diggy dig on bone)
Giving my girl the whole replay (Bone diggy dig on bone)
Tell me what to do (Bone diggy dig on bone)

Now ladies know how to stick together, together
No matter what you say you ain't gon' win (Mmm mmm)
Brothers, better have yo stuff together, together
But she always gon' believe her friend (Bone diggy dig on bone)
She always gon' believe her friend (Bone diggy dig on bone)
