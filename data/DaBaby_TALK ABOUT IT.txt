Baby (Wheezy outta here)
Let's go

My uncles taught a nigga how to hustle
My mama taught me how to use a rubber
I was six years old tryna sell a nigga candy
All I knew was how to get the money (Let's go)
I done broke a lot of records in a year now
GRAMMY-nominated nigga, bitch, it's lit now
I was tryna tell 'em I was special as a jit
I still'll open fire on a nigga, make him get down (Get down, get down)

Yeah, bitch, you ain't seen a nigga do it like Baby (Uh-uh)
Big chain and I'm solo in this bitch
Glock four-five, AP and four bracelets (Let's go)
I just spent three million on the crib (Three Ms)
And I don't even be there, I just did it for my baby (No cap)
You prolly never met a nigga like me
Really 'bout whatever, from the bottom like the basement (The bottom)
You might have a point but I ain't finna argue with you
Won't go back and forth, I be done shot him
I'm in the studio, I got my daughter with me in a Fendi dress, she rockin' diamonds (From Johnny)
Light show, nigga (Let's go)
Heat me up, I got my ice on, nigga
I be signin' million-dollar deals with my fingertips on eSign on my fuckin' iPhone, nigga
I'm the nigga, let me talk about it (Wheezy outta here)

Court dates for the New Year (2020)
Twenty on the lawyer, twenty-seven thousand for a jet I never boarded
Everybody in the county treat a nigga like the truth (Truth)
Lock the jail down every time a nigga move (Lockdown)
In a dirty-ass cell, doin' push-ups, eatin' soup
The media believin' 'em, they wanna see me go back
Rich nigga can't rob a broke nigga and you know that
Locked a nigga up in South Florida like he Kodak
A quarter-million dollars in my motherfuckin' tote bag
They think I like to fight until a nigga get a toe tag (Boom)
Hang his jersey up, his shit a throwback (Throwback)
Police ain't know me, they don't wanna see me bubble
Pretty-ass smile like my motherfuckin' mother
All the nigga know is hustle, multi-million dollar nigga
Got to stay up out of trouble, I'm the realest nigga in it
Let me talk about it (Wheezy outta here)
