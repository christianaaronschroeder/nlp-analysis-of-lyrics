(Mustard on the beat, ho)

So much stack, I wanna thank your mama
And everybody know why
Too much that both hands can't grab
But best believe I'm gon' try
Got 5 percent on my window
No seeing into my ride
Don't think too hard, girl, let's go
Give me your thoughts while I drive
Come on, baby, tell me, baby, tell me right now
We can make that back seat to 'tel right now
Adjust the rear view, oh, that's the clear view
Girl, I hope you're ready, hope you're ready right now
And dance is a hobby, oh, good lordy
Nothing get the Porches, but she's a Bugatti
Break push start it, break push start it
Baby, don't hurt nobody

Baby, pump your breaks
I think you need to pull over
Come on and swerve my way
Back it up, let me slow up
'Cause baby, I see you
All up in my rear view
Yeah, I see you
But I need a rear view
All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see
All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see

Girl I like that, crack in my mirror
Give me bad luck like that hourglass figure
Ringing my wing 'til that thing get bigger
Curve like a trigger, wanna cut you like a scissor
That's it, baby, nearer, I love your hind side
From the back, you're a winner
Thick skirts, thick, get it feda prime dinner
Get it, twerk it, shake it 'til my knee cap shiver, yeah
Don't I like what's below that spine?
Both cheeks shaking at the same damn time
Shorty be my lady, can't replace that wine
Presidential status on my Rollie face shine
See, when that jiggle it's official, call it 808
Some toilet tissue, you know the shit, let that marinade
Like something, bitch, you wanna yum-bum celebrate
You know it's real when I sayâ€”
Baby, pump your breaks
I think you need to pull over
Come on and swerve my way
Back it up, let me slow up
'Cause baby, I see you
All up in my rear view
Yeah, I see you
But I need a rear view

All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see
All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see

Now we in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor, babe
Speed it up, speed it up
Don't stop, I'ma beat it up, beat it up
Someone call the cops
Now we in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor, babe
Speed it up, speed it up
Don't stop, I'ma beat it up, beat it up
Baby, I'm speeding
Baby, pump your breaks
I think you need to pull over
Come on and swerve my way
Back it up, let me slow up
'Cause baby, I see you
All up in my rear view
Yeah, I see you
But I need a rear view

All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see
All of that, in them jeans
I think you need to back, back it up on me
Saying all of that, in them jeans
Need a rear view, girl, let me see
