Birds flying high
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)

Yeah, I'm a new man, baby
Your other men probably should follow my blueprint, baby
Strap on your seat, and get ready to go
You know I've been filling BeatPort
3 million feed up in the sky full diamonds
I'm only beginning and I get the feeling
I'm behind the beat for the nighters
I got a few Miami Viaces
I don't ever look at the prices
My super bowl tickets are priced less
You know who the king of the night is
Beautiful music for you to go lower
And when girl go work, this for life
I think I'm bipolar
Birds flying high
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)

What a feeling I get when I throw up my pistols
From party, and bigger than life
50 bottles of Luminis
24 kick, pop my dollars, wake up for the night
Cameras flickin', I see me
You're fixing, I'm fixin' my color
My natural height
She can get it, my whole click wit it
No question, we are on the champion flight
This is how I ride, my passenger fly
We take off in London, end up in Dubai
This is a marriage, the music my ride
My life is so lavish, you don't recognize
So let's toast to a new day approachin'
80 million, they still rollercoasting
What's the recipe to this devotion?
I got the melody, sober like couches
(Oh-eh-oh) Who told y'all the party's over?
(Oh-eh-oh) Well, it ain't over til I told y'all
I feel my cup runnin' over
Tomorrow I  might be sober
But oh, tonight, I'm like...

Birds flying high (Ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
It's a new day
And you know how I feel
