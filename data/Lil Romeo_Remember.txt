I remember the first time we met you was quiet as kept
Cubic dimples hair done in barrettes
Charc carmel
A keep a secret never tattle tell
We been holding our own
Never get mad and tell
Someone who would ride with me
Be on my side with me
Be a friend
Spend time with me
Rollercoaster
Three wheel motion
Wide open
You under ocean
Big teddy bears
Cotton candy every where
We can do this thing evereyday every year
Come on and talk to me
