You know when i arrive it's when it starts the party
I'm buyin' all this clothes cause they fit on my body
Boys sayin' please gyal I want you to be my shawty
But i keep on my money fuck you's every morning
They see me spending, either thinking that I'm hottie
They don't know that I miss that every weekend party
But then it ends the month and I see all this paper
I feel like I'm in heaven this couldn't be better
Tinc quatre xulos que em volen
Clar que ells no saben que em molen
En el meu cor encara apareixes
Sometimes només per fotre nosa
Ja no em serveixen les roses (no gracias migo)
Ja no m'expliquis mes coses
Tu em vas fer cendres
Ja em diuen menos, volen fer-me la seva esposa
These guys keep callin' me mami
I keep sayin you're not my homie
I'm feeling so good that you annoy me
You think so but you don't know me
I do what i like even lonely
I used to call you my papi
But now I'm alone, I'm feeling my zone
Just seeing guys cuz they love me
Leiris, you must keep your head up, you must be yourselves
Cap de tots aquests nois us portarà al cel
I'm the bitch that's playing harder in this fucking game
I just started counting money i see there's no end
They see me on the street, they all look at me
They know that i got it
They want to take me, they think that i'm rich
He buys me a ferrari
I'm not selling bricks, i won't be your bitch, won't come to your party (never ever)
Don't ask me to fuck, don't mind nothing more
I won't be your mami
Leiris, you must keep your head up, you must be yourselves
Cap de tots aquests nois us portarà al cel
Jo m'ho faig soleta freda com el gel
Tu em claves l'espineta no en vull saber res
Thinking 'bout those days I used to have you crazy
Fucking til the morning, like the house wasn't empty
Saying stupid things, ara ni que les pensi
Leiris, you must keep your head up, you must be yourselves
Cap de tots aquests nois us portarà al cel
I'm the bitch that's playing harder in this fucking game
I just started counting money i see there's no end
