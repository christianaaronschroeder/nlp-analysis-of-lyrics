Are you ready for the beaches?
Are you ready for the weekends?
Are you ready for the summer?
'Cause summer's not ready for me
Are you ready for the long nights?
With your body lookin' just right
Are you ready for the summer?
'Cause summer's not ready for me

Uh, game stopped, it was ready for me
Stock going up heavy on me
No stress on me
Put that Patek on me
I keep a check on me
Your girl sex on me
She likes summertime, number six, number nine
Lemon-lime, man, I mix it up and give it to her, baby, anytime
I got plenty time, push that thing into mine
I know exactly what to do, baby, you, baby, you ain't (Ready)
I mean, you probably got a dude, but you ain't (Ready)
Slim thick, summer fine, get (Ready)
Pump that beat, you funky little bomb

Are you ready for the beaches?
Are you ready for the weekends?
Are you ready for the summer? (Summertime, bae)
'Cause summer's not ready for me
Are you ready for the long nights?
With your body lookin' just right (Just right)
Are you ready for the summer?
'Cause summer's not ready for me
I think you're ready for the main event (Yeah)
Come and get it, baby, play to win (Play to win)
Spread it for me, don't get spread too thin (Yeah)
If I'm too much, baby, hit two friends
I got the Seamoth
Summer body lookin' like Ibiza (Ibiza)
She'll do anything for a visa (Yeah)
She got the fever
She gon' squirt a liter
Saucy, I'm fever
Lookin' like no gag reflex, respect
Fresh out the pack, no defects, secret
Baby, no hands and that's on T-Rex
Throw bands, OnlyFans might be next
Summer come, then I'm coming, we can ball
Yeah, I put the summer off, summer '20 was a loss
But we back home and it's finger licking good 'til the last drop
Sasquatch with the back shots (Yeah)

Yeah
I must confess
I'm freakiest
In the summertime
Can I get an amen? (Amen)
I'll get some rest
When summer ends
So let me blow your mind
Ayy
