You say you got it
You say you know me, how you get it, how you got it
You say you 'bout it
You say you know me, how I get it out the projects
I shoot out the Holy Ghost
Hold on, I grab the toast
I'm sippin' on codeine
I feel like I overdosed
I shoot up like morphine
Hold on, I got more fiends
Pull up on that dope lean
Huh, say you got it

Had to get my dough right
Get it more right, pour that four right, all that, all that roll right
In the club with some bitches, wanna suck it all night
Wanna fuck it all night
Be Tupacin' with my niggas, we be thuggin' all night
All of this ice and it's all bright
I walk in the spot and need no lights
R.I.P. to Kimbo Slice
Shout out to Drake to get more life
'Member days, the kick door life
Keep a salad, fuck the poor life
'Stafa, I be feelin' like Mustafa, hey
My son is Simba niggas, call 'em finish hittas
I got getters get us
You say you got it
You say you know me, how you get it, how you got it
You say you 'bout it
You say you know me, how I get it out the projects
I shoot out the Holy ghost
Hold on, I grab the toast
I'm sippin' on codeine
I feel like I overdosed
I shoot up like morphine
Hold on, I got more fiends
Pull up on that dopamine
Huh, say you got it
You say you know me, how you get it, how you got it
You say you 'bout it
You say you know me, how I get it out the projects
I shoot out the Holy Ghost
Hold on, I grab the toast
I'm sippin' on codeine
I feel like I overdosed
I shoot up like morphine
Hold on, I got more fiends
Pull up on that dope lean
Huh, say you got it

Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost
Ride in the drop, that's that Holy Ghost
Holy shake, do the Holy Ghost
Holy shit 'cause I'm wholly rich
I'ma drive in the Lamb, watch 'em take a pic
I skrrt on that ass 'fore you take the flick
I'ma fuck on Rihanna, put her all in designer
Diamonds last forever, last forever
We gon' blast together, I'm on top of the building ain't falling
Crash the weather, we gon' clash together
Feel light as a feather
Hey, this the real
Hey, this how you feel
I was gettin' money without no deal
Watch it fall in the fire, it's hot as hell
This for real
You say you got it
You say you know me, how you get it, how you got it
You say you 'bout it
You say you know me, how I get it out the projects
I shoot out the Holy Ghost
Hold on, I grab the toast

I feel like I overdosed
I shoot up like morphine
Hold on, I got more fiends
Pull up on that dope lean
Huh, say you got it
